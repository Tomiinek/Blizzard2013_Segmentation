000001|"no, not I," said Silver.
000002|Flint was cap'n;
000003|I was quartermaster, along of my timber leg.
000004|The same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost his deadlights.
000005|It was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me -- out of college and all -- Latin by the bucket, and what not;
000006|but he was hanged like a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle.
000007|That was Roberts' men, that was, and comed of changing names to their ships -- royal fortune and so on.
000008|Now, what a ship was christened, so let her stay, I says.
000009|So it was with the cassandra, as brought us all safe home from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies;
000010|so it was with the old walrus, Flint's old ship, as I've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold.
000011|"Ah!" cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and evidently full of admiration.
000012|He was the flower of the flock, was Flint!
000013|"Davis was a man too, by all accounts," said Silver.
000014|I never sailed along of him;
000015|first with England, then with Flint, that's my story;
000016|and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking.
000017|I laid by nine hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint.
000018|That ain't bad for a man before the mast -- all safe in bank.
000019|'Tain't earning now, it's saving does it, you may lay to that.
000020|Where's all England's men now?
000021|I dunno.
000022|Where's Flint's?
000023|Why, most on 'em aboard here, and glad to get the duff -- been begging before that, some on 'em.
000024|Old Pew, as had lost his sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in a year, like a lord in Parliament.
000025|Where is he now?
000026|Well, he's dead now and under hatches;
000027|but for two year before that, shiver my timbers, the man was starving!
000028|He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and starved at that, by the powers!
000029|"Well, it ain't much use, after all," said the young seaman.
000030|"'Tain't much use for fools, you may lay to it -- that, nor nothing," cried Silver.
000031|But now, you look here: you're young, you are, but you're as smart as paint.
000032|I see that when I set my eyes on you, and I'll talk to you like a man.
000033|You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself.
000034|I think, if I had been able, that I would have killed him through the barrel.
000035|Meantime, he ran on, little supposing he was overheard.
000036|Here it is about gentlemen of fortune.
000037|They lives rough, and they risk swinging, but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks, and when a cruise is done, why, it's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets.
000038|Now, the most goes for rum and a good fling, and to sea again in their shirts.
000039|But that's not the course I lay.
000040|I puts it all away, some here, some there, and none too much anywheres, by reason of suspicion.
000041|I'm fifty, mark you;
000042|once back from this cruise, I set up gentleman in earnest.
000043|Time enough too, says you.
000044|Ah, but I've lived easy in the meantime, never denied myself o' nothing heart desires, and slep' soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea.
000045|And how did I begin?
000046|Before the mast, like you!
000047|"Well," said the other, "but all the other money's gone now, ain't it?"
000048|You daren't show face in Bristol after this.
000049|"Why, where might you suppose it was?" asked Silver derisively.
000050|"At Bristol, in banks and places," answered his companion.
000051|"It were," said the cook;
000052|it were when we weighed anchor.
000053|But my old missis has it all by now.
000054|And the Spy-glass is sold, lease and goodwill and rigging;
000055|and the old girl's off to meet me.
000056|I would tell you where, for I trust you, but it'd make jealousy among the mates.
000057|"And can you trust your missis?" asked the other.
000058|"Gentlemen of fortune," returned the cook, "usually trusts little among themselves, and right they are, you may lay to it."
000059|But I have a way with me, I have.
000060|When a mate brings a slip on his cable -- one as knows me, I mean -- it won't be in the same world with old John.
000061|There was some that was feared of Pew, and some that was feared of Flint;
000062|but Flint his own self was feared of me.
000063|Feared he was, and proud.
000064|They was the roughest crew afloat, was Flint's;
000065|the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them.
000066|Well now, I tell you, I'm not a boasting man, and you seen yourself how easy I keep company, but when I was quartermaster, lambs wasn't the word for Flint's old buccaneers.
000067|Ah, you may be sure of yourself in old John's ship.
000068|"Well, I tell you now," replied the lad, "I didn't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you, John;"
000069|but there's my hand on it now.
000070|"And a brave lad you were, and smart too," answered Silver, shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook, "and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on."
000071|By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms.
000072|By a "gentleman of fortune" they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands -- perhaps of the last one left aboard.
000073|But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for Silver giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the party.
000074|"Dick's square," said Silver.
000075|"Oh, I know'd Dick was square," returned the voice of the coxswain, Israel Hands.
000076|He's no fool, is Dick.
000077|And he turned his quid and spat.
000078|"But look here," he went on, "here's what I want to know, Barbecue: how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat?"
000079|I've had a'most enough o' Cap'n Smollett;
000080|he's hazed me long enough, by thunder!
000081|I want to go into that cabin, I do.
000082|I want their pickles and wines, and that.
000083|"Israel," said Silver, "your head ain't much account, nor ever was."
000084|But you're able to hear, I reckon;
000085|leastways, your ears is big enough.
000086|Now, here's what I say: you'll berth forward, and you'll live hard, and you'll speak soft, and you'll keep sober till I give the word;
000087|and you may lay to that, my son.
000088|"Well, I don't say no, do I?" growled the coxswain.
000089|What I say is, when?
000090|That's what I say.
000091|When!
000092|"By the powers!" cried Silver.
000093|Well now, if you want to know, I'll tell you when.
000094|The last moment I can manage, and that's when.
000095|Here's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us.
000096|Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such -- I don't know where it is, do I?
000097|No more do you, says you.
000098|Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers.
000099|Then we'll see.
000100|If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.
000101|"Why, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think," said the lad Dick.
000102|"We're all forecastle hands, you mean," snapped Silver.
000103|We can steer a course, but who's to set one?
000104|That's what all you gentlemen split on, first and last.
000105|If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least;
000106|then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day.
000107|But I know the sort you are.
000108|I'll finish with 'em at the island, as soon's the blunt's on board, and a pity it is.
000109|But you're never happy till you're drunk.
000110|Split my sides, I've a sick heart to sail with the likes of you!
000111|"Easy all, Long John," cried Israel.
000112|Who's a-crossin' of you?
000113|Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard?
000114|"And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock?" cried Silver.
000115|And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry.
000116|You hear me?
000117|I seen a thing or two at sea, I have.
000118|If you would on'y lay your course, and a p'int to windward, you would ride in carriages, you would.
000119|But not you!
000120|I know you.
000121|You'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow, and go hang.
000122|Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling, John;
000123|"but there's others as could hand and steer as well as you," said Israel.
000124|They liked a bit o' fun, they did.
000125|They wasn't so high and dry, nohow, but took their fling, like jolly companions every one.
000126|"So?" says Silver.
000127|Well, and where are they now?
000128|Pew was that sort, and he died a beggar-man.
000129|Flint was, and he died of rum at Savannah.
000130|Ah, they was a sweet crew, they was!
000131|On'y, where are they?
000132|"But," asked Dick, "when we do lay 'em athwart, what are we to do with 'em, anyhow?"
000133|"There's the man for me!" cried the cook admiringly.
000134|That's what I call business.
000135|Well, what would you think?
000136|Put 'em ashore like maroons?
000137|That would have been England's way.
000138|Or cut 'em down like that much pork?
000139|That would have been Flint's, or Billy Bones's.
000140|"Billy was the man for that," said Israel.
000141|'Dead men don't bite,' says he.
000142|Well, he's dead now hisself;
000143|he knows the long and short on it now;
000144|and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.
000145|"Right you are," said Silver;
000146|rough and ready.
000147|But mark you here, I'm an easy man -- I'm quite the gentleman, says you;
000148|but this time it's serious.
000149|Dooty is dooty, mates.
000150|I give my vote -- death.
000151|When I'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach, I don't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers.
000152|Wait is what I say;
000153|but when the time comes, why, let her rip!
000154|"John," cries the coxswain, "you're a man!"
000155|"You'll say so, Israel when you see," said Silver.
000156|Only one thing I claim -- I claim Trelawney.
000157|"I'll wring his calf's head off his body with these hands, Dick!" he added, breaking off.
000158|You just jump up, like a sweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.
000159|You may fancy the terror I was in!
000160|I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength, but my limbs and heart alike misgave me.
000161|I heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and the voice of Hands exclaimed, "Oh, stow that!"
000162|Don't you get sucking of that bilge, John.
000163|Let's have a go of the rum.
000164|"Dick," said Silver, "I trust you."
000165|I've a gauge on the keg, mind.
000166|There's the key;
000167|you fill a pannikin and bring it up.
000168|Terrified as I was, I could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how mister Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him.
000169|Dick was gone but a little while, and during his absence Israel spoke straight on in the cook's ear.
000170|It was but a word or two that I could catch, and yet I gathered some important news, for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose, this whole clause was audible: "Not another man of them'll jine."
000171|Hence there were still faithful men on board.
000172|When Dick returned, one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drank -- one "To luck," another with a "Here's to old Flint," and Silver himself saying, in a kind of song, "Here's to ourselves, and hold your luff, plenty of prizes and plenty of duff."
000173|Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel, and looking up, I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and shining white on the luff of the fore-sail;
