000001|from the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees.
000002|My eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine.
000003|What it was, whether bear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell.
000004|It seemed dark and shaggy;
000005|more I knew not.
000006|But the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand.
000007|I was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides;
000008|behind me the murderers, before me this lurking nondescript.
000009|And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew not.
000010|Silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I turned on my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats.
000011|Instantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit, began to head me off.
000012|I was tired, at any rate;
000013|but had I been as fresh as when I rose, I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary.
000014|From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping almost double as it ran.
000015|Yet a man it was, I could no longer be in doubt about that.
000016|I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals.
000017|I was within an ace of calling for help.
000018|But the mere fact that he was a man, however wild, had somewhat reassured me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion.
000019|I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of escape;
000020|and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind.
000021|As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless, courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him.
000022|He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk;
000023|but he must have been watching me closely, for as soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me.
000024|Then he hesitated, drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication.
000025|At that I once more stopped.
000026|"Who are you?" I asked.
000027|"Ben Gunn," he answered, and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward, like a rusty lock.
000028|I'm poor Ben Gunn, I am;
000029|and I haven't spoke with a Christian these three years.
000030|I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing.
000031|His skin, wherever it was exposed, was burnt by the sun;
000032|even his lips were black, and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face.
000033|Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or fancied, he was the chief for raggedness.
000034|He was clothed with tatters of old ship's canvas and old sea-cloth, and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings, brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin.
000035|About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement.
000036|"Three years!" I cried.
000037|Were you shipwrecked?
000038|"Nay, mate," said he;
000039|marooned.
000040|I had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers, in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island.
000041|"Marooned three years agone," he continued, "and lived on goats since then, and berries, and oysters."
000042|Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself.
000043|But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet.
000044|You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now?
000045|No?
000046|Well, many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese -- toasted, mostly -- and woke up again, and here I were.
000047|"If ever I can get aboard again," said I, "you shall have cheese by the stone."
000048|All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket, smoothing my hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the intervals of his speech, showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature.
000049|But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness.
000050|"If ever you can get aboard again, says you?" he repeated.
000051|Why, now, who's to hinder you?
000052|"Not you, I know," was my reply.
000053|"And right you was," he cried.
000054|Now you -- what do you call yourself, mate?
000055|"Jim," I told him.
000056|"Jim, Jim," says he, quite pleased apparently.
000057|Well, now, Jim, I've lived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of.
000058|"Now, for instance, you wouldn't think I had had a pious mother -- to look at me?" he asked.
000059|"Why, no, not in particular," I answered.
000060|"Ah, well," said he, "but I had -- remarkable pious."
000061|And I was a civil, pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn't tell one word from another.
000062|And here's what it come to, Jim, and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones!
000063|That's what it begun with, but it went further'n that;
000064|and so my mother told me, and predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman!
000065|But it were Providence that put me here.
000066|I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety.
000067|You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have.
000068|I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to.
000069|"And, Jim" -- looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper -- "I'm rich."
000070|I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: "Rich!"
000071|Rich!
000072|I says.
000073|And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim.
000074|Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!
000075|And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes.
000076|"Now, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?" he asked.
000077|At this I had a happy inspiration.
000078|I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once.
000079|It's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead;
000080|but I'll tell you true, as you ask me -- there are some of Flint's hands aboard;
000081|worse luck for the rest of us.
000082|"Not a man -- with one -- leg?" he gasped.
000083|"Silver?" I asked.
000084|"Ah, Silver!" says he.
000085|That were his name.
000086|He's the cook, and the ringleader too.
000087|He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a wring.
000088|"If you was sent by Long John," he said, "I'm as good as pork, and I know it."
000089|But where was you, do you suppose?
000090|I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves.
000091|He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he patted me on the head.
000092|"You're a good lad, Jim," he said;
000093|and you're all in a clove hitch, ain't you?
000094|Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn -- Ben Gunn's the man to do it.
000095|Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help -- him being in a clove hitch, as you remark?
000096|I told him the squire was the most liberal of men.
000097|"Aye, but you see," returned Ben Gunn, "I didn't mean giving me a gate to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such;"
000098|that's not my mark, Jim.
000099|What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say one thousand pounds out of money that's as good as a man's own already?
000100|"I am sure he would," said I.
000101|As it was, all hands were to share.
000102|"and a passage home?" he added with a look of great shrewdness.
000103|"Why," I cried, "the squire's a gentleman."
000104|And besides, if we got rid of the others, we should want you to help work the vessel home.
000105|"Ah," said he, "so you would."
000106|And he seemed very much relieved.
000107|"Now, I'll tell you what," he went on.
000108|So much I'll tell you, and no more.
000109|I were in Flint's ship when he buried the treasure;
000110|he and six along -- six strong seamen.
000111|They was ashore nigh on a week, and us standing off and on in the old walrus.
000112|One fine day up went the signal, and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in a blue scarf.
000113|The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about the cutwater.
000114|But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead -- dead and buried.
000115|How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out.
000116|It was battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways -- him against six.
000117|Billy Bones was the mate;
000118|Long John, he was quartermaster;
000119|and they asked him where the treasure was.
000120|'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like, and stay,' he says;
000121|'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by thunder!' That's what he said.
000122|Well, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this island.
000123|'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure;
000124|let's land and find it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a mind and landed.
000125|Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard.
000126|'As for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and a spade, and pick-axe.
000127|You can stay here and find Flint's money for yourself,' they says.
000128|Well, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this.
000129|But now, you look here;
000130|look at me.
000131|Do I look like a man before the mast?
000132|No, says you.
000133|Nor I weren't, neither, I says.
000134|And with that he winked and pinched me hard.
000135|"Just you mention them words to your squire, Jim," he went on.
000136|Nor he weren't, neither -- that's the words.
000137|Three years he were the man of this island, light and dark, fair and rain;
000138|and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother, so be as she's alive (you'll say);
000139|but the most part of Gunn's time (this is what you'll say) -- the most part of his time was took up with another matter.
000140|And then you'll give him a nip, like I do.
000141|And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner.
000142|"Then," he continued, "then you'll up, and you'll say this: Gunn is a good man (you'll say), and he puts a precious sight more confidence -- a precious sight, mind that -- in a gen'leman born than in these gen'leman of fortune, having been one hisself."
000143|"Well," I said, "I don't understand one word that you've been saying."
000144|But that's neither here nor there;
000145|for how am I to get on board?
000146|"Ah," said he, "that's the hitch, for sure."
000147|Well, there's my boat, that I made with my two hands.
000148|I keep her under the white rock.
000149|If the worst come to the worst, we might try that after dark.
000150|"Hi!" he broke out.
000151|What's that?
000152|For just then, although the sun had still an hour or two to run, all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon.
000153|"They have begun to fight!" I cried.
000154|Follow me.
000155|And I began to run towards the anchorage, my terrors all forgotten, while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly.
000156|"Left, left," says he;
000157|keep to your left hand, mate Jim!
000158|Under the trees with you!
000159|Theer's where I killed my first goat.
000160|They don't come down here now;
000161|they're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of Benjamin Gunn.
000162|Ah!
000163|"And there's the cetemery" -- cemetery, he must have meant.
000164|You see the mounds?
000165|I come here and prayed, nows and thens, when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo.
000166|It weren't quite a chapel, but it seemed more solemn like;
000167|and then, says you, Ben Gunn was short-handed -- no chapling, nor so much as a Bible and a flag, you says.
000168|So he kept talking as I ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer.
000169|The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms.
