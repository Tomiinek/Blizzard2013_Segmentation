000001|When his head was out of sight Colin turned to Mary.
000002|"Go and meet him," he said;
000003|and Mary flew across the grass to the door under the ivy.
000004|Dickon was watching him with sharp eyes.
000005|There were scarlet spots on his cheeks and he looked amazing, but he showed no signs of falling.
000006|"I can stand," he said, and his head was still held up and he said it quite grandly.
000007|"I told thee tha' could as soon as tha' stopped bein' afraid," answered Dickon.
000008|An' tha's stopped.
000009|"Yes, I've stopped," said Colin.
000010|Then suddenly he remembered something Mary had said.
000011|"Are you making Magic?" he asked sharply.
000012|Dickon's curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin.
000013|"Tha's doin' Magic thysel'," he said.
000014|"It's same Magic as made these 'ere work out o' th' earth," and he touched with his thick boot a clump of crocuses in the grass.
000015|Colin looked down at them.
000016|"Aye," he said slowly, "there couldna' be bigger Magic than that there -- there couldna' be."
000017|He drew himself up straighter than ever.
000018|"I'm going to walk to that tree," he said, pointing to one a few feet away from him.
000019|I'm going to be standing when Weatherstaff comes here.
000020|I can rest against the tree if I like.
000021|When I want to sit down I will sit down, but not before.
000022|Bring a rug from the chair.
000023|He walked to the tree and though Dickon held his arm he was wonderfully steady.
000024|When he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that he supported himself against it, and he still held himself so straight that he looked tall.
000025|When Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he saw him standing there and he heard Mary muttering something under her breath.
000026|"What art sayin'?" he asked rather testily because he did not want his attention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proud face.
000027|But she did not tell him.
000028|What she was saying was this:
000029|You can do it!
000030|You can do it!
000031|I told you you could!
000032|You can do it!
000033|You can do it!
000034|You can!
000035|She was saying it to Colin because she wanted to make Magic and keep him on his feet looking like that.
000036|She could not bear that he should give in before Ben Weatherstaff.
000037|He did not give in.
000038|She was uplifted by a sudden feeling that he looked quite beautiful in spite of his thinness.
000039|He fixed his eyes on Ben Weatherstaff in his funny imperious way.
000040|"Look at me!" he commanded.
000041|Look at me all over!
000042|Am I a hunchback?
000043|Have I got crooked legs?
000044|Ben Weatherstaff had not quite got over his emotion, but he had recovered a little and answered almost in his usual way.
000045|"Not tha'," he said.
000046|Nowt o' th' sort.
000047|What's tha' been doin' with thysel' -- hidin' out o' sight an' lettin' folk think tha' was cripple an' half-witted?
000048|"Half-witted!" said Colin angrily.
000049|Who thought that?
000050|"Lots o' fools," said Ben.
000051|Th' world's full o' jackasses brayin' an' they never bray nowt but lies.
000052|What did tha' shut thysel' up for?
000053|"Everyone thought I was going to die," said Colin shortly.
000054|I'm not!
000055|And he said it with such decision Ben Weatherstaff looked him over, up and down, down and up.
000056|"Tha' die!" he said with dry exultation.
000057|Nowt o' th' sort!
000058|Tha's got too much pluck in thee.
000059|When I seed thee put tha' legs on th' ground in such a hurry I knowed tha' was all right.
000060|Sit thee down on th' rug a bit young Mester an' give me thy orders.
000061|There was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd understanding in his manner.
000062|Mary had poured out speech as rapidly as she could as they had come down the Long Walk.
000063|The chief thing to be remembered, she had told him, was that Colin was getting well -- getting well.
000064|The garden was doing it.
000065|No one must let him remember about having humps and dying.
000066|The Rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under the tree.
000067|"What work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff?" he inquired.
000068|"Anythin' I'm told to do," answered old Ben.
000069|I'm kep' on by favor -- because she liked me.
000070|"She?" said Colin.
000071|"Tha' mother," answered Ben Weatherstaff.
000072|"My mother?" said Colin, and he looked about him quietly.
000073|This was her garden, wasn't it?
000074|"Aye, it was that!" and Ben Weatherstaff looked about him too.
000075|She were main fond of it.
000076|It is my garden now.
000077|I am fond of it.
000078|"I shall come here every day," announced Colin.
000079|But it is to be a secret.
000080|My orders are that no one is to know that we come here.
000081|Dickon and my cousin have worked and made it come alive.
000082|I shall send for you sometimes to help -- but you must come when no one can see you.
000083|Ben Weatherstaff's face twisted itself in a dry old smile.
000084|"I've come here before when no one saw me," he said.
000085|"What!" exclaimed Colin.
000086|When?
000087|"Th' last time I was here," rubbing his chin and looking round, "was about two year' ago."
000088|"But no one has been in it for ten years!" cried Colin.
000089|There was no door!
000090|"I'm no one," said old Ben dryly.
000091|An' I didn't come through th' door.
000092|I come over th' wall.
000093|Th' rheumatics held me back th' last two year'.
000094|"Tha' come an' did a bit o' prunin'!" cried Dickon.
000095|I couldn't make out how it had been done.
000096|"She was so fond of it -- she was!" said Ben Weatherstaff slowly.
000097|An' she was such a pretty young thing.
000098|She says to me once, 'Ben,' says she laughin', 'if ever I'm ill or if I go away you must take care of my roses.' When she did go away th' orders was no one was ever to come nigh.
000099|"But I come," with grumpy obstinacy.
000100|Over th' wall I come -- until th' rheumatics stopped me -- an' I did a bit o' work once a year.
000101|She'd gave her order first.
000102|"It wouldn't have been as wick as it is if tha' hadn't done it," said Dickon.
000103|I did wonder.
000104|"I'm glad you did it, Weatherstaff," said Colin.
000105|You'll know how to keep the secret.
000106|"Aye, I'll know, sir," answered Ben.
000107|An' it'll be easier for a man wi' rheumatics to come in at th' door.
000108|On the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her trowel.
000109|Colin stretched out his hand and took it up.
000110|An odd expression came into his face and he began to scratch at the earth.
000111|His thin hand was weak enough but presently as they watched him -- Mary with quite breathless interest -- he drove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some over.
000112|You can do it!
000113|"You can do it!" said Mary to herself.
000114|I tell you, you can!
000115|Dickon's round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he said not a word.
000116|Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested face.
000117|Colin persevered.
000118|After he had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he spoke exultantly to Dickon in his best Yorkshire.
000119|Tha' said as tha'd have me walkin' about here same as other folk -- an' tha' said tha'd have me diggin'.
000120|I thowt tha' was just leein' to please me.
000121|This is only th' first day an' I've walked -- an' here I am diggin'.
000122|Ben Weatherstaff's mouth fell open again when he heard him, but he ended by chuckling.
000123|"Eh!" he said, "that sounds as if tha'd got wits enow."
000124|Tha'rt a Yorkshire lad for sure.
000125|An' tha'rt diggin', too.
000126|How'd tha' like to plant a bit o' somethin'?
000127|I can get thee a rose in a pot.
000128|"Go and get it!" said Colin, digging excitedly.
000129|Quick!
000130|Quick!
000131|It was done quickly enough indeed.
000132|Ben Weatherstaff went his way forgetting rheumatics.
000133|Dickon took his spade and dug the hole deeper and wider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it.
000134|Mary slipped out to run and bring back a watering-can.
000135|When Dickon had deepened the hole Colin went on turning the soft earth over and over.
000136|He looked up at the sky, flushed and glowing with the strangely new exercise, slight as it was.
000137|"I want to do it before the sun goes quite -- quite down," he said.
000138|Mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on purpose.
000139|Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from the greenhouse.
000140|He hobbled over the grass as fast as he could.
000141|He had begun to be excited, too.
000142|He knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from the mould.
000143|"Here, lad," he said, handing the plant to Colin.
000144|Set it in the earth thysel' same as th' king does when he goes to a new place.
000145|The thin white hands shook a little and Colin's flush grew deeper as he set the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the earth.
000146|It was filled in and pressed down and made steady.
000147|Mary was leaning forward on her hands and knees.
000148|Soot had flown down and marched forward to see what was being done.
000149|Nut and Shell chattered about it from a cherry-tree.
000150|"It's planted!" said Colin at last.
000151|And the sun is only slipping over the edge.
000152|Help me up, Dickon.
000153|I want to be standing when it goes.
000154|That's part of the Magic.
