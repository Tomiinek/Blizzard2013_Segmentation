000001|They must have had good courage to climb all those rocks, for after getting out of the canyon they encountered more rock hills to be surmounted.
000002|Toto could jump from one rock to another quite easily, but the others had to creep and climb with care, so that after a whole day of such work Dorothy and Ojo found themselves very tired.
000003|As they gazed upward at the great mass of tumbled rocks that covered the steep incline, Dorothy gave a little groan and said:
000004|That's going to be a ter'ble hard climb, Scarecrow.
000005|I wish we could find the dark well without so much trouble.
000006|"Suppose," said Ojo, "you wait here and let me do the climbing, for it's on my account we're searching for the dark well."
000007|Then, if I don't find anything, I'll come back and join you.
000008|"No," replied the little girl, shaking her head positively, "we'll all go together, for that way we can help each other."
000009|If you went alone, something might happen to you, Ojo.
000010|So they began the climb and found it indeed difficult, for a way.
000011|But presently, in creeping over the big crags, they found a path at their feet which wound in and out among the masses of rock and was quite smooth and easy to walk upon.
000012|As the path gradually ascended the mountain, although in a roundabout way, they decided to follow it.
000013|"This must be the road to the Country of the Hoppers," said the Scarecrow.
000014|"Who are the Hoppers?" asked Dorothy.
000015|"Some people Jack Pumpkinhead told me about," he replied.
000016|"I didn't hear him," replied the girl.
000017|"No; you were asleep," explained the Scarecrow.
000018|But he told Scraps and me that the Hoppers and the Horners live on this mountain.
000019|"He said in the mountain," declared Scraps;
000020|but of course he meant on it.
000021|"Didn't he say what the Hoppers and Horners were like?" inquired Dorothy.
000022|No;
000023|he only said they were two separate nations, and that the Horners were the most important.
000024|"Well, if we go to their country we'll find out all about 'em," said the girl.
000025|But I've never heard Ozma mention those people, so they can't be very important.
000026|"Is this mountain in the Land of Oz?" asked Scraps.
000027|"Course it is," answered Dorothy.
000028|It's in the South Country of the Quadlings.
000029|When one comes to the edge of Oz, in any direction, there is nothing more to be seen at all.
000030|Once you could see sandy desert all around Oz;
000031|but now it's diff'rent, and no other people can see us, any more than we can see them.
000032|"If the mountain is under Ozma's rule, why doesn't she know about the Hoppers and the Horners?" Ojo asked.
000033|"Why, it's a fairyland," explained Dorothy, "and lots of queer people live in places so tucked away that those in the Emerald City never even hear of 'em."
000034|In the middle of the country it's diff'rent, but when you get around the edges you're sure to run into strange little corners that surprise you.
000035|I know, for I've traveled in Oz a good deal, and so has the Scarecrow.
000036|"Yes," admitted the straw man, "I've been considerable of a traveler, in my time, and I like to explore strange places."
000037|I find I learn much more by traveling than by staying at home.
000038|During this conversation they had been walking up the steep pathway and now found themselves well up on the mountain.
000039|They could see nothing around them, for the rocks beside their path were higher than their heads.
000040|Nor could they see far in front of them, because the path was so crooked.
000041|But suddenly they stopped, because the path ended and there was no place to go.
000042|Ahead was a big rock lying against the side of the mountain, and this blocked the way completely.
000043|"There wouldn't be a path, though, if it didn't go somewhere," said the Scarecrow, wrinkling his forehead in deep thought.
000044|"This is somewhere, isn't it?" asked the Patchwork Girl, laughing at the bewildered looks of the others.
000045|The path is locked, the way is blocked, Yet here we've innocently flocked;
000046|And now we're here it's rather queer There's no front door that can be knocked.
000047|"Please don't, Scraps," said Ojo.
000048|You make me nervous.
000049|"Well," said Dorothy, "I'm glad of a little rest, for that's a drea'ful steep path."
000050|As she spoke she leaned against the edge of the big rock that stood in their way.
000051|To her surprise it slowly swung backward and showed behind it a dark hole that looked like the mouth of a tunnel.
000052|"Why, here's where the path goes to!" she exclaimed.
000053|"So it is," answered the Scarecrow.
000054|But the question is, do we want to go where the path does?
000055|It's underground;
000056|"right inside the mountain," said Ojo, peering into the dark hole.
000057|Perhaps there's a well there;
000058|and, if there is, it's sure to be a dark one.
000059|"Why, that's true enough!" cried Dorothy with eagerness.
000060|Let's go in, Scarecrow;
000061|'cause, if others have gone, we're pretty safe to go, too.
000062|Toto looked in and barked, but he did not venture to enter until the Scarecrow had bravely gone first.
000063|Scraps followed closely after the straw man and then Ojo and Dorothy timidly stepped inside the tunnel.
000064|As soon as all of them had passed the big rock, it slowly turned and filled up the opening again;
000065|but now they were no longer in the dark, for a soft, rosy light enabled them to see around them quite distinctly.
000066|It was only a passage, wide enough for two of them to walk abreast -- with Toto in between them -- and it had a high, arched roof.
000067|They could not see where the light which flooded the place so pleasantly came from, for there were no lamps anywhere visible.
000068|The passage ran straight for a little way and then made a bend to the right and another sharp turn to the left, after which it went straight again.
000069|But there were no side passages, so they could not lose their way.
000070|After proceeding some distance, Toto, who had gone on ahead, began to bark loudly.
000071|They ran around a bend to see what was the matter and found a man sitting on the floor of the passage and leaning his back against the wall.
000072|He had probably been asleep before Toto's barks aroused him, for he was now rubbing his eyes and staring at the little dog with all his might.
000073|There was something about this man that Toto objected to, and when he slowly rose to his foot they saw what it was.
000074|He had but one leg, set just below the middle of his round, fat body;
000075|but it was a stout leg and had a broad, flat foot at the bottom of it, on which the man seemed to stand very well.
000076|He had never had but this one leg, which looked something like a pedestal, and when Toto ran up and made a grab at the man's ankle he hopped first one way and then another in a very active manner, looking so frightened that Scraps laughed aloud.
000077|Toto was usually a well behaved dog, but this time he was angry and snapped at the man's leg again and again.
000078|This filled the poor fellow with fear, and in hopping out of Toto's reach he suddenly lost his balance and tumbled heel over head upon the floor.
000079|When he sat up he kicked Toto on the nose and made the dog howl angrily, but Dorothy now ran forward and caught Toto's collar, holding him back.
000080|"Do you surrender?" she asked the man.
000081|"Who? Me?" asked the Hopper.
000082|"Yes; you," said the little girl.
000083|"Am I captured?" he inquired.
000084|Of course.
000085|"My dog has captured you," she said.
000086|"Well," replied the man, "if I'm captured I must surrender, for it's the proper thing to do."
000087|I like to do everything proper, for it saves one a lot of trouble.
000088|"It does, indeed," said Dorothy.
000089|Please tell us who you are.
000090|I'm Hip Hopper -- Hip Hopper, the Champion.
000091|"Champion what?" she asked in surprise.
000092|Champion wrestler.
000093|I'm a very strong man, and that ferocious animal which you are so kindly holding is the first living thing that has ever conquered me.
000094|"And you are a Hopper?" she continued.
000095|Yes.
000096|My people live in a great city not far from here.
000097|Would you like to visit it?
000098|"I'm not sure," she said with hesitation.
000099|Have you any dark wells in your city?
000100|I think not.
000101|We have wells, you know, but they're all well lighted, and a well lighted well cannot well be a dark well.
000102|But there may be such a thing as a very dark well in the Horner Country, which is a black spot on the face of the earth.
000103|"Where is the Horner Country?" Ojo inquired.
000104|The other side of the mountain.
000105|There's a fence between the Hopper Country and the Horner Country, and a gate in the fence;
000106|but you can't pass through just now, because we are at war with the Horners.
000107|"That's too bad," said the Scarecrow.
000108|What seems to be the trouble?
000109|Why, one of them made a very insulting remark about my people.
000110|He said we were lacking in understanding, because we had only one leg to a person.
000111|I can't see that legs have anything to do with understanding things.
000112|The Horners each have two legs, just as you have.
000113|That's one leg too many, it seems to me.
000114|"No," declared Dorothy, "it's just the right number."
000115|"You don't need them," argued the Hopper, obstinately.
000116|You've only one head, and one body, and one nose and mouth.
000117|Two legs are quite unnecessary, and they spoil one's shape.
000118|"But how can you walk, with only one leg?" asked Ojo.
000119|"Walk! Who wants to walk?" exclaimed the man.
000120|Walking is a terribly awkward way to travel.
000121|I hop, and so do all my people.
000122|It's so much more graceful and agreeable than walking.
000123|"I don't agree with you," said the Scarecrow.
000124|But tell me, is there any way to get to the Horner Country without going through the city of the Hoppers?
000125|Yes; there is another path from the rocky lowlands, outside the mountain, that leads straight to the entrance of the Horner Country.
000126|But it's a long way around, so you'd better come with me.
000127|Perhaps they will allow you to go through the gate;
000128|but we expect to conquer them this afternoon, if we get time, and then you may go and come as you please.
000129|They thought it best to take the Hopper's advice, and asked him to lead the way.
