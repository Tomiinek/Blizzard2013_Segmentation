000001|The boy was so bewildered by this calamity that he made no resistance at all.
000002|He knew very well he was guilty, but it surprised him that Ozma also knew it.
000003|He wondered how she had found out so soon that he had picked the six-leaved clover.
000004|He handed his basket to Scraps and said:
000005|Keep that, until I get out of prison.
000006|If I never get out, take it to the Crooked Magician, to whom it belongs.
000007|The Shaggy Man had been gazing earnestly in the boy's face, uncertain whether to defend him or not;
000008|but something he read in Ojo's expression made him draw back and refuse to interfere to save him.
000009|The Shaggy Man was greatly surprised and grieved, but he knew that Ozma never made mistakes and so Ojo must really have broken the Law of Oz.
000010|The Soldier with the Green Whiskers now led them all through the gate and into a little room built in the wall.
000011|Here sat a jolly little man, richly dressed in green and having around his neck a heavy gold chain to which a number of great golden keys were attached.
000012|This was the Guardian of the Gate and at the moment they entered his room he was playing a tune upon a mouth-organ.
000013|"Listen!" he said, holding up his hand for silence.
000014|I've just composed a tune called 'The Speckled Alligator.' It's in patch-time, which is much superior to rag-time, and I've composed it in honor of the Patchwork Girl, who has just arrived.
000015|"How did you know I had arrived?" asked Scraps, much interested.
000016|It's my business to know who's coming, for I'm the Guardian of the Gate.
000017|Keep quiet while I play you 'The Speckled Alligator.'
000018|It wasn't a very bad tune, nor a very good one, but all listened respectfully while he shut his eyes and swayed his head from side to side and blew the notes from the little instrument.
000019|When it was all over the Soldier with the Green Whiskers said:
000020|Guardian, I have here a prisoner.
000021|Good gracious!
000022|"A prisoner?" cried the little man, jumping up from his chair.
000023|Which one?
000024|Not the Shaggy Man?
000025|No; this boy.
000026|"Ah; I hope his fault is as small as himself," said the Guardian of the Gate.
000027|But what can he have done, and what made him do it?
000028|"Can't say," replied the soldier.
000029|All I know is that he has broken the Law.
000030|But no one ever does that!
000031|Then he must be innocent, and soon will be released.
000032|I hope you are right, Guardian.
000033|Just now I am ordered to take him to prison.
000034|Get me a prisoner's robe from your Official Wardrobe.
000035|The Guardian unlocked a closet and took from it a white robe, which the soldier threw over Ojo.
000036|It covered him from head to foot, but had two holes just in front of his eyes, so he could see where to go.
000037|In this attire the boy presented a very quaint appearance.
000038|As the Guardian unlocked a gate leading from his room into the streets of the Emerald City, the Shaggy Man said to Scraps:
000039|I think I shall take you directly to Dorothy, as the Scarecrow advised, and the Glass Cat and the Woozy may come with us.
000040|Ojo must go to prison with the Soldier with the Green Whiskers, but he will be well treated and you need not worry about him.
000041|"What will they do with him?" asked Scraps.
000042|That I cannot tell.
000043|Since I came to the Land of Oz no one has ever been arrested or imprisoned -- until Ojo broke the Law.
000044|"Seems to me that girl Ruler of yours is making a big fuss over nothing," remarked Scraps, tossing her yarn hair out of her eyes with a jerk of her patched head.
000045|I don't know what Ojo has done, but it couldn't be anything very bad, for you and I were with him all the time.
000046|The Shaggy Man made no reply to this speech and presently the Patchwork Girl forgot all about Ojo in her admiration of the wonderful city she had entered.
000047|They soon separated from the Munchkin boy, who was led by the Soldier with the Green Whiskers down a side street toward the prison.
000048|Ojo felt very miserable and greatly ashamed of himself, but he was beginning to grow angry because he was treated in such a disgraceful manner.
000049|Instead of entering the splendid Emerald City as a respectable traveler who was entitled to a welcome and to hospitality, he was being brought in as a criminal, handcuffed and in a robe that told all he met of his deep disgrace.
000050|Ojo was by nature gentle and affectionate and if he had disobeyed the Law of Oz it was to restore his dear Unc Nunkie to life.
000051|His fault was more thoughtless than wicked, but that did not alter the fact that he had committed a faultimate.
000052|At first he had felt sorrow and remorse, but the more he thought about the unjust treatment he had received -- unjust merely because he considered it so -- the more he resented his arrest, blaming Ozma for making foolish laws and then punishing folks who broke them.
000053|Only a six-leaved clover!
000054|A tiny green plant growing neglected and trampled under foot.
000055|What harm could there be in picking it?
000056|Ojo began to think Ozma must be a very bad and oppressive Ruler for such a lovely fairyland as Oz.
000057|The Shaggy Man said the people loved her;
000058|but how could they?
000059|The little Munchkin boy was so busy thinking these things -- which many guilty prisoners have thought before him -- that he scarcely noticed all the splendor of the city streets through which they passed.
000060|Whenever they met any of the happy, smiling people, the boy turned his head away in shame, although none knew who was beneath the robe.
000061|By and by they reached a house built just beside the great city wall, but in a quiet, retired place.
000062|It was a pretty house, neatly painted and with many windows.
000063|Before it was a garden filled with blooming flowers.
000064|The Soldier with the Green Whiskers led Ojo up the gravel path to the front door, on which he knocked.
000065|A woman opened the door and, seeing Ojo in his white robe, exclaimed:
000066|Goodness me!
000067|A prisoner at last.
000068|But what a small one, Soldier.
000069|The size doesn't matter, Tollydiggle, my dear.
000070|"The fact remains that he is a prisoner," said the soldier.
000071|And, this being the prison, and you the jailer, it is my duty to place the prisoner in your charge.
000072|True.
000073|Come in, then, and I'll give you a receipt for him.
000074|They entered the house and passed through a hall to a large circular room, where the woman pulled the robe off from Ojo and looked at him with kindly interest.
000075|The boy, on his part, was gazing around him in amazement, for never had he dreamed of such a magnificent apartment as this in which he stood.
000076|The roof of the dome was of colored glass, worked into beautiful designs.
000077|The walls were paneled with plates of gold decorated with gems of great size and many colors, and upon the tiled floor were soft rugs delightful to walk upon.
000078|The furniture was framed in gold and upholstered in satin brocade and it consisted of easy chairs, divans and stools in great variety.
000079|Also there were several tables with mirror tops and cabinets filled with rare and curious things.
000080|In one place a case filled with books stood against the wall, and elsewhere Ojo saw a cupboard containing all sorts of games.
000081|"May I stay here a little while before I go to prison?" asked the boy, pleadingly.
000082|"Why, this is your prison," replied Tollydiggle, "and in me behold your jailor."
000083|Take off those handcuffs, Soldier, for it is impossible for anyone to escape from this house.
000084|"I know that very well," replied the soldier and at once unlocked the handcuffs and released the prisoner.
000085|The woman touched a button on the wall and lighted a big chandelier that hung suspended from the ceiling, for it was growing dark outside.
000086|Then she seated herself at a desk and asked:
000087|What name?
000088|"Ojo the Unlucky," answered the Soldier with the Green Whiskers.
000089|Unlucky?
000090|"Ah, that accounts for it," said she.
000091|What crime?
000092|Breaking a Law of Oz.
000093|All right.
000094|There's your receipt, Soldier;
000095|and now I'm responsible for the prisoner.
000096|"I'm glad of it, for this is the first time I've ever had anything to do, in my official capacity," remarked the jailer, in a pleased tone.
000097|"It's the same with me, Tollydiggle," laughed the soldier.
000098|But my task is finished and I must go and report to Ozma that I've done my duty like a faithful Police Force, a loyal Army and an honest Body-Guard -- as I hope I am.
000099|Saying this, he nodded farewell to Tollydiggle and Ojo and went away.
000100|"Now, then," said the woman briskly, "I must get you some supper, for you are doubtless hungry."
000101|What would you prefer: planked whitefish, omelet with jelly or mutton-chops with gravy?
000102|Ojo thought about it.
000103|Then he said: "I'll take the chops, if you please."
000104|Very well;
000105|amuse yourself while I'm gone;
000106|"I won't be long," and then she went out by a door and left the prisoner alone.
000107|Ojo was much astonished, for not only was this unlike any prison he had ever heard of, but he was being treated more as a guest than a criminal.
000108|There were many windows and they had no locks.
000109|There were three doors to the room and none were bolted.
000110|He cautiously opened one of the doors and found it led into a hallway.
000111|But he had no intention of trying to escape.
000112|If his jailor was willing to trust him in this way he would not betray her trust, and moreover a hot supper was being prepared for him and his prison was very pleasant and comfortable.
000113|So he took a book from the case and sat down in a big chair to look at the pictures.
000114|This amused him until the woman came in with a large tray and spread a cloth on one of the tables.
000115|Then she arranged his supper, which proved the most varied and delicious meal Ojo had ever eaten in his life.
000116|Tollydiggle sat near him while he ate, sewing on some fancy work she held in her lap.
000117|When he had finished she cleared the table and then read to him a story from one of the books.
000118|"Is this really a prison?" he asked, when she had finished reading.
000119|"Indeed it is," she replied.
000120|It is the only prison in the Land of Oz.
000121|And am I a prisoner?
000122|Bless the child!
000123|Of course.
000124|"Then why is the prison so fine, and why are you so kind to me?" he earnestly asked.
000125|Tollydiggle seemed surprised by the question, but she presently answered:
000126|We consider a prisoner unfortunate.
000127|He is unfortunate in two ways -- because he has done something wrong and because he is deprived of his liberty.
000128|Therefore we should treat him kindly, because of his misfortune, for otherwise he would become hard and bitter and would not be sorry he had done wrong.
000129|Ozma thinks that one who has committed a fault did so because he was not strong and brave;
000130|therefore she puts him in prison to make him strong and brave.
000131|When that is accomplished he is no longer a prisoner, but a good and loyal citizen and everyone is glad that he is now strong enough to resist doing wrong.
000132|You see, it is kindness that makes one strong and brave;
000133|and so we are kind to our prisoners.
000134|Ojo thought this over very carefully.
000135|"I had an idea," said he, "that prisoners were always treated harshly, to punish them."
000136|"That would be dreadful!" cried Tollydiggle.
000137|Isn't one punished enough in knowing he has done wrong?
000138|Don't you wish, Ojo, with all your heart, that you had not been disobedient and broken a Law of Oz?
000139|"I -- I hate to be different from other people," he admitted.
000140|"Yes; one likes to be respected as highly as his neighbors are," said the woman.
000141|When you are tried and found guilty, you will be obliged to make amends, in some way.
000142|I don't know just what Ozma will do to you, because this is the first time one of us has broken a Law;
000143|but you may be sure she will be just and merciful.
000144|Here in the Emerald City people are too happy and contented ever to do wrong;
000145|but perhaps you came from some faraway corner of our land, and having no love for Ozma carelessly broke one of her Laws.
000146|"Yes," said Ojo, "I've lived all my life in the heart of a lonely forest, where I saw no one but dear Unc Nunkie."
000147|"I thought so," said Tollydiggle.
