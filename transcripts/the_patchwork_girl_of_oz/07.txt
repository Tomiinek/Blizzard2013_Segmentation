000001|On they went, and half an hour's steady walking brought them to a house somewhat better than the two they had already passed.
000002|It stood close to the roadside and over the door was a sign that read: "Miss Foolish Owl and mister Wise Donkey: Public Advisers."
000003|When Ojo read this sign aloud Scraps said laughingly: "Well, here is a place to get all the advice we want, maybe more than we need."
000004|Let's go in.
000005|The boy knocked at the door.
000006|"Come in!" called a deep bass voice.
000007|So they opened the door and entered the house, where a little light-brown donkey, dressed in a blue apron and a blue cap, was engaged in dusting the furniture with a blue cloth.
000008|On a shelf over the window sat a great blue owl with a blue sunbonnet on her head, blinking her big round eyes at the visitors.
000009|"Good morning," said the donkey, in his deep voice, which seemed bigger than he was.
000010|Did you come to us for advice?
000011|"Why, we came, anyhow," replied Scraps, "and now we are here we may as well have some advice."
000012|It's free, isn't it?
000013|"Certainly," said the donkey.
000014|Advice doesn't cost anything -- unless you follow it.
000015|Permit me to say, by the way, that you are the queerest lot of travelers that ever came to my shop.
000016|Judging you merely by appearances, I think you'd better talk to the Foolish Owl yonder.
000017|They turned to look at the bird, which fluttered its wings and stared back at them with its big eyes.
000018|"Hoot-ti-toot-ti-toot!" cried the owl.
000019|Fiddle-cum-foo, Howdy-do?
000020|Riddle-cum, tiddle-cum, Too-ra-la-loo!
000021|"That beats your poetry, Scraps," said Ojo.
000022|"It's just nonsense!" declared the Glass Cat.
000023|"But it's good advice for the foolish," said the donkey, admiringly.
000024|Listen to my partner, and you can't go wrong.
000025|Said the owl in a grumbling voice:
000026|Patchwork Girl has come to life;
000027|No one's sweetheart, no one's wife;
000028|Lacking sense and loving fun, She'll be snubbed by everyone.
000029|Quite a compliment!
000030|"Quite a compliment, I declare," exclaimed the donkey, turning to look at Scraps.
000031|You are certainly a wonder, my dear, and I fancy you'd make a splendid pincushion.
000032|If you belonged to me, I'd wear smoked glasses when I looked at you.
000033|"Why?" asked the Patchwork Girl.
000034|Because you are so gay and gaudy.
000035|"It is my beauty that dazzles you," she asserted.
000036|You Munchkin people all strut around in your stupid blue color, while I
000037|"You are wrong in calling me a Munchkin," interrupted the donkey, "for I was born in the Land of Mo and came to visit the Land of Oz on the day it was shut off from all the rest of the world."
000038|So here I am obliged to stay, and I confess it is a very pleasant country to live in.
000039|"Hoot-ti-toot!" cried the owl;
000040|Ojo's searching for a charm, 'Cause Unc Nunkie's come to harm.
000041|Charms are scarce;
000042|they're hard to get;
000043|Ojo's got a job, you bet!
000044|"Is the owl so very foolish?" asked the boy.
000045|"Extremely so," replied the donkey.
000046|Notice what vulgar expressions she uses.
000047|But I admire the owl for the reason that she is positively foolish.
000048|Owls are supposed to be so very wise, generally, that a foolish one is unusual, and you perhaps know that anything or anyone unusual is sure to be interesting to the wise.
000049|The owl flapped its wings again, muttering these words:
000050|It's hard to be a glassy cat -- No cat can be more hard than that;
000051|She's so transparent, every act Is clear to us, and that's a fact.
000052|"Have you noticed my pink brains?" inquired Bungle, proudly.
000053|You can see 'em work.
000054|"Not in the daytime," said the donkey.
000055|She can't see very well by day, poor thing.
000056|But her advice is excellent.
000057|I advise you all to follow it.
000058|"The owl hasn't given us any advice, as yet," the boy declared.
000059|No?
000060|Then what do you call all those sweet poems?
000061|"Just foolishness," replied Ojo.
000062|Scraps does the same thing.
000063|Foolishness!
000064|Of course!
000065|To be sure!
000066|The Foolish Owl must be foolish or she wouldn't be the Foolish Owl.
000067|"You are very complimentary to my partner, indeed," asserted the donkey, rubbing his front hoofs together as if highly pleased.
000068|"The sign says that you are wise," remarked Scraps to the donkey.
000069|I wish you would prove it.
000070|"With great pleasure," returned the beast.
000071|Put me to the test, my dear Patches, and I'll prove my wisdom in the wink of an eye.
000072|"What is the best way to get to the Emerald City?" asked Ojo.
000073|"Walk," said the donkey.
000074|I know;
000075|"but what road shall I take?" was the boy's next question.
000076|The road of yellow bricks, of course.
000077|It leads directly to the Emerald City.
000078|And how shall we find the road of yellow bricks?
000079|By keeping along the path you have been following.
000080|You'll come to the yellow bricks pretty soon, and you'll know them when you see them because they're the only yellow things in the blue country.
000081|"Thank you," said the boy.
000082|At last you have told me something.
000083|"Is that the extent of your wisdom?" asked Scraps.
000084|"No," replied the donkey;
000085|I know many other things, but they wouldn't interest you.
000086|So I'll give you a last word of advice: move on, for the sooner you do that the sooner you'll get to the Emerald City of Oz.
000087|"Hoot-ti-toot-ti-toot-ti-too!" screeched the owl;
000088|Off you go!
000089|fast or slow, Where you're going you don't know.
000090|Patches, Bungle, Munchkin lad, Facing fortunes good and bad, Meeting dangers grave and sad, Sometimes worried, sometimes glad -- Where you're going you don't know, Nor do I, but off you go!
000091|"Sounds like a hint, to me," said the Patchwork Girl.
000092|"Then let's take it and go," replied Ojo.
