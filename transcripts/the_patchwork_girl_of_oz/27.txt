000001|When Ojo entered the room he ran quickly to the statue of Unc Nunkie and kissed the marble face affectionately.
000002|"I did my best, Unc," he said, with a sob, "but it was no use!"
000003|Then he drew back and looked around the room, and the sight of the assembled company quite amazed him.
000004|Aside from the marble statues of Unc Nunkie and Margolotte, the Glass Cat was there, curled up on a rug;
000005|and the Woozy was there, sitting on its square hind legs and looking on the scene with solemn interest;
000006|and there was the Shaggy Man, in a suit of shaggy pea-green satin, and at a table sat the little Wizard, looking quite important and as if he knew much more than he cared to tell.
000007|Last of all, doctor Pipt was there, and the Crooked Magician sat humped up in a chair, seeming very dejected but keeping his eyes fixed on the lifeless form of his wife Margolotte, whom he fondly loved but whom he now feared was lost to him forever.
000008|Ozma took a chair which Jellia Jamb wheeled forward for the Ruler, and back of her stood the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and Dorothy, as well as the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger.
000009|The Wizard now arose and made a low bow to Ozma and another less deferent bow to the assembled company.
000010|"Ladies and gentlemen and beasts," he said, "I beg to announce that our Gracious Ruler has permitted me to obey the commands of the great Sorceress, Glinda the Good, whose humble Assistant I am proud to be."
000011|We have discovered that the Crooked Magician has been indulging in his magical arts contrary to Law, and therefore, by Royal Edict, I hereby deprive him of all power to work magic in the future.
000012|He is no longer a crooked magician, but a simple Munchkin;
000013|he is no longer even crooked, but a man like other men.
000014|As he pronounced these words the Wizard waved his hand toward doctor Pipt and instantly every crooked limb straightened out and became perfect.
000015|The former magician, with a cry of joy, sprang to his feet, looked at himself in wonder, and then fell back in his chair and watched the Wizard with fascinated interest.
000016|"The Glass Cat, which doctor Pipt lawlessly made," continued the Wizard, "is a pretty cat, but its pink brains made it so conceited that it was a disagreeable companion to everyone."
000017|So the other day I took away the pink brains and replaced them with transparent ones, and now the Glass Cat is so modest and well behaved that Ozma has decided to keep her in the palace as a pet.
000018|"I thank you," said the cat, in a soft voice.
000019|"The Woozy has proved himself a good Woozy and a faithful friend," the Wizard went on, "so we will send him to the Royal Menagerie, where he will have good care and plenty to eat all his life."
000020|"Much obliged," said the Woozy.
000021|That beats being fenced up in a lonely forest and starved.
000022|"As for the Patchwork Girl," resumed the Wizard, "she is so remarkable in appearance, and so clever and good tempered, that our Gracious Ruler intends to preserve her carefully, as one of the curiosities of the curious Land of Oz."
000023|Scraps may live in the palace, or wherever she pleases, and be nobody's servant but her own.
000024|"That's all right," said Scraps.
000025|"We have all been interested in Ojo," the little Wizard continued, "because his love for his unfortunate uncle has led him bravely to face all sorts of dangers, in order that he might rescue him."
000026|The Munchkin boy has a loyal and generous heart and has done his best to restore Unc Nunkie to life.
000027|He has failed, but there are others more powerful than the Crooked Magician, and there are more ways than doctor Pipt knew of to destroy the charm of the Liquid of Petrifaction.
000028|Glinda the Good has told me of one way, and you shall now learn how great is the knowledge and power of our peerless Sorceress.
000029|As he said this the Wizard advanced to the statue of Margolote and made a magic pass, at the same time muttering a magic word that none could hear distinctly.
000030|At once the woman moved, turned her head wonderingly this way and that, to note all who stood before her, and seeing doctor Pipt, ran forward and threw herself into her husband's outstretched arms.
000031|Then the Wizard made the magic pass and spoke the magic word before the statue of Unc Nunkie.
000032|The old Munchkin immediately came to life and with a low bow to the Wizard said: "Thanks."
000033|But now Ojo rushed up and threw his arms joyfully about his uncle, and the old man hugged his little nephew tenderly and stroked his hair and wiped away the boy's tears with a handkerchief, for Ojo was crying from pure happiness.
000034|Ozma came forward to congratulate them.
000035|"I have given to you, my dear Ojo and Unc Nunkie, a nice house just outside the walls of the Emerald City," she said, "and there you shall make your future home and be under my protection."
000036|"Didn't I say you were Ojo the Lucky?" asked the Tin Woodman, as everyone crowded around to shake Ojo's hand.
