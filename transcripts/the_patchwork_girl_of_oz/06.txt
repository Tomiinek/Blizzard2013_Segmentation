000001|When the boy opened his eyes next morning he looked carefully around the room.
000002|These small Munchkin houses seldom had more than one room in them.
000003|That in which Ojo now found himself had three beds, set all in a row on one side of it.
000004|The Glass Cat lay asleep on one bed, Ojo was in the second, and the third was neatly made up and smoothed for the day.
000005|On the other side of the room was a round table on which breakfast was already placed, smoking hot.
000006|Only one chair was drawn up to the table, where a place was set for one person.
000007|No one seemed to be in the room except the boy and Bungle.
000008|Ojo got up and put on his shoes.
000009|Finding a toilet stand at the head of his bed he washed his face and hands and brushed his hair.
000010|Then he went to the table and said:
000011|I wonder if this is my breakfast?
000012|"Eat it!" commanded a Voice at his side, so near that Ojo jumped.
000013|But no person could he see.
000014|He was hungry, and the breakfast looked good;
000015|so he sat down and ate all he wanted.
000016|Then, rising, he took his hat and wakened the Glass Cat.
000017|"Come on, Bungle," said he;
000018|we must go.
000019|He cast another glance about the room and, speaking to the air, he said: "Whoever lives here has been kind to me, and I'm much obliged."
000020|There was no answer, so he took his basket and went out the door, the cat following him.
000021|In the middle of the path sat the Patchwork Girl, playing with pebbles she had picked up.
000022|"Oh, there you are!" she exclaimed cheerfully.
000023|I thought you were never coming out.
000024|It has been daylight a long time.
000025|"What did you do all night?" asked the boy.
000026|"Sat here and watched the stars and the moon," she replied.
000027|They're interesting.
000028|I never saw them before, you know.
000029|"Of course not," said Ojo.
000030|"You were crazy to act so badly and get thrown outdoors," remarked Bungle, as they renewed their journey.
000031|"That's all right," said Scraps.
000032|If I hadn't been thrown out I wouldn't have seen the stars, nor the big gray wolf.
000033|"What wolf?" inquired Ojo.
000034|The one that came to the door of the house three times during the night.
000035|"I don't see why that should be," said the boy, thoughtfully;
000036|there was plenty to eat in that house, for I had a fine breakfast, and I slept in a nice bed.
000037|"Don't you feel tired?" asked the Patchwork Girl, noticing that the boy yawned.
000038|Why, yes;
000039|I'm as tired as I was last night;
000040|and yet I slept very well.
000041|And aren't you hungry?
000042|"It's strange," replied Ojo.
000043|I had a good breakfast, and yet I think I'll now eat some of my crackers and cheese.
000044|Scraps danced up and down the path.
000045|Then she sang:
000046|Kizzle-kazzle-kore;
000047|The wolf is at the door, There's nothing to eat but a bone without meat, And a bill from the grocery store.
000048|"What does that mean?" asked Ojo.
000049|"Don't ask me," replied Scraps.
000050|I say what comes into my head, but of course I know nothing of a grocery store or bones without meat or -- very much else.
000051|"No," said the cat;
000052|she's stark, staring, raving crazy, and her brains can't be pink, for they don't work properly.
000053|"Bother the brains!" cried Scraps.
000054|Who cares for 'em, anyhow?
000055|Have you noticed how beautiful my patches are in this sunlight?
000056|Just then they heard a sound as of footsteps pattering along the path behind them and all three turned to see what was coming.
000057|To their astonishment they beheld a small round table running as fast as its four spindle legs could carry it, and to the top was screwed fast a phonograph with a big gold horn.
000058|"Hold on!" shouted the phonograph.
000059|Wait for me!
000060|Goodness me;
000061|"it's that music thing which the Crooked Magician scattered the Powder of Life over," said Ojo.
000062|"So it is," returned Bungle, in a grumpy tone of voice;
000063|and then, as the phonograph overtook them, the Glass Cat added sternly: "What are you doing here, anyhow?"
000064|"I've run away," said the music thing.
000065|After you left, old doctor Pipt and I had a dreadful quarrel and he threatened to smash me to pieces if I didn't keep quiet.
000066|Of course I wouldn't do that, because a talking-machine is supposed to talk and make a noise -- and sometimes music.
000067|So I slipped out of the house while the Magician was stirring his four kettles and I've been running after you all night.
000068|Now that I've found such pleasant company, I can talk and play tunes all I want to.
000069|Ojo was greatly annoyed by this unwelcome addition to their party.
000070|At first he did not know what to say to the newcomer, but a little thought decided him not to make friends.
000071|"We are traveling on important business," he declared, "and you'll excuse me if I say we can't be bothered."
000072|"How very impolite!" exclaimed the phonograph.
000073|I'm sorry;
000074|"but it's true," said the boy.
000075|You'll have to go somewhere else.
000076|"This is very unkind treatment, I must say," whined the phonograph, in an injured tone.
000077|Everyone seems to hate me, and yet I was intended to amuse people.
000078|"It isn't you we hate, especially," observed the Glass Cat;
000079|it's your dreadful music.
000080|When I lived in the same room with you I was much annoyed by your squeaky horn.
000081|It growls and grumbles and clicks and scratches so it spoils the music, and your machinery rumbles so that the racket drowns every tune you attempt.
000082|That isn't my fault;
000083|it's the fault of my records.
000084|"I must admit that I haven't a clear record," answered the machine.
000085|"Just the same, you'll have to go away," said Ojo.
000086|"Wait a minute," cried Scraps.
000087|This music thing interests me.
000088|I remember to have heard music when I first came to life, and I would like to hear it again.
000089|What is your name, my poor abused phonograph?
000090|"Victor Columbia Edison," it answered.
000091|"Well, I shall call you 'Vic' for short," said the Patchwork Girl.
000092|Go ahead and play something.
000093|"It'll drive you crazy," warned the cat.
000094|I'm crazy now, according to your statement.
000095|Loosen up and reel out the music, Vic.
000096|"The only record I have with me," explained the phonograph, "is one the Magician attached just before we had our quarrel."
000097|It's a highly classical composition.
000098|"A what?" inquired Scraps.
000099|It is classical music, and is considered the best and most puzzling ever manufactured.
000100|You're supposed to like it, whether you do or not, and if you don't, the proper thing is to look as if you did.
000101|Understand?
000102|"Not in the least," said Scraps.
000103|Then, listen!
000104|At once the machine began to play and in a few minutes Ojo put his hands to his ears to shut out the sounds and the cat snarled and Scraps began to laugh.
000105|"Cut it out, Vic," she said.
000106|That's enough.
000107|But the phonograph continued playing the dreary tune, so Ojo seized the crank, jerked it free and threw it into the road.
000108|However, the moment the crank struck the ground it bounded back to the machine again and began winding it up.
000109|And still the music played.
000110|"Let's run!" cried Scraps, and they all started and ran down the path as fast as they could go.
000111|But the phonograph was right behind them and could run and play at the same time.
000112|It called out, reproachfully:
000113|What's the matter?
000114|Don't you love classical music?
000115|"No, Vic," said Scraps, halting.
000116|We will passical the classical and preserve what joy we have left.
000117|I haven't any nerves, thank goodness, but your music makes my cotton shrink.
000118|Then turn over my record.
000119|"There's a rag-time tune on the other side," said the machine.
000120|What's rag-time?
000121|The opposite of classical.
000122|"All right," said Scraps, and turned over the record.
000123|The phonograph now began to play a jerky jumble of sounds which proved so bewildering that after a moment Scraps stuffed her patchwork apron into the gold horn and cried: "Stop -- stop!"
000124|That's the other extreme.
000125|It's extremely bad!
000126|Muffled as it was, the phonograph played on.
000127|"If you don't shut off that music I'll smash your record," threatened Ojo.
000128|The music stopped, at that, and the machine turned its horn from one to another and said with great indignation: "What's the matter now?"
000129|Is it possible you can't appreciate rag-time?
000130|"Scraps ought to, being rags herself," said the cat;
000131|but I simply can't stand it;
000132|it makes my whiskers curl.
000133|"It is, indeed, dreadful!" exclaimed Ojo, with a shudder.
000134|"It's enough to drive a crazy lady mad," murmured the Patchwork Girl.
000135|"I'll tell you what, Vic," she added as she smoothed out her apron and put it on again, "for some reason or other you've missed your guess."
000136|You're not a concert;
000137|you're a nuisance.
000138|"Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast," asserted the phonograph sadly.
000139|Then we're not savages.
000140|I advise you to go home and beg the Magician's pardon.
000141|Never!
000142|He'd smash me.
000143|"That's what we shall do, if you stay here," Ojo declared.
000144|"Run along, Vic, and bother some one else," advised Scraps.
000145|Find some one who is real wicked, and stay with him till he repents.
000146|In that way you can do some good in the world.
000147|The music thing turned silently away and trotted down a side path, toward a distant Munchkin village.
000148|"Is that the way we go?" asked Bungle anxiously.
000149|"No," said Ojo;
000150|I think we shall keep straight ahead, for this path is the widest and best.
