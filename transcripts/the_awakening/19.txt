000001|Edna could not help but think that it was very foolish, very childish, to have stamped upon her wedding ring and smashed the crystal vase upon the tiles.
000002|She was visited by no more outbursts, moving her to such futile expedients.
000003|She began to do as she liked and to feel as she liked.
000004|She completely abandoned her Tuesdays at home, and did not return the visits of those who had called upon her.
000005|She made no ineffectual efforts to conduct her household en bonne menagere, going and coming as it suited her fancy, and, so far as she was able, lending herself to any passing caprice.
000006|mister Pontellier had been a rather courteous husband so long as he met a certain tacit submissiveness in his wife.
000007|But her new and unexpected line of conduct completely bewildered him.
000008|It shocked him.
000009|Then her absolute disregard for her duties as a wife angered him.
000010|When mister Pontellier became rude, Edna grew insolent.
000011|She had resolved never to take another step backward.
000012|It seems to me the utmost folly for a woman at the head of a household, and the mother of children, to spend in an atelier days which would be better employed contriving for the comfort of her family.
000013|"I feel like painting," answered Edna.
000014|Perhaps I shan't always feel like it.
000015|Then in God's name paint!
000016|but don't let the family go to the devil.
000017|There's Madame Ratignolle;
000018|because she keeps up her music, she doesn't let everything else go to chaos.
000019|And she's more of a musician than you are a painter.
000020|She isn't a musician, and I'm not a painter.
000021|It isn't on account of painting that I let things go.
000022|On account of what, then?
000023|Oh! I don't know.
000024|Let me alone;
000025|you bother me.
000026|It sometimes entered mister Pontellier's mind to wonder if his wife were not growing a little unbalanced mentally.
000027|He could see plainly that she was not herself.
000028|That is, he could not see that she was becoming herself and daily casting aside that fictitious self which we assume like a garment with which to appear before the world.
000029|Her husband let her alone as she requested, and went away to his office.
000030|Edna went up to her atelier -- a bright room in the top of the house.
000031|She was working with great energy and interest, without accomplishing anything, however, which satisfied her even in the smallest degree.
000032|For a time she had the whole household enrolled in the service of art.
000033|The boys posed for her.
000034|They thought it amusing at first, but the occupation soon lost its attractiveness when they discovered that it was not a game arranged especially for their entertainment.
000035|The quadroon sat for hours before Edna's palette, patient as a savage, while the house-maid took charge of the children, and the drawing-room went undusted.
000036|But the housemaid, too, served her term as model when Edna perceived that the young woman's back and shoulders were molded on classic lines, and that her hair, loosened from its confining cap, became an inspiration.
000037|While Edna worked she sometimes sang low the little air: "Ah! si tu savais!"
000038|It moved her with recollections.
000039|She could hear again the ripple of the water, the flapping sail.
000040|She could see the glint of the moon upon the bay, and could feel the soft, gusty beating of the hot south wind.
000041|A subtle current of desire passed through her body, weakening her hold upon the brushes and making her eyes burn.
000042|There were days when she was very happy without knowing why.
000043|She was happy to be alive and breathing, when her whole being seemed to be one with the sunlight, the color, the odors, the luxuriant warmth of some perfect Southern day.
000044|She liked then to wander alone into strange and unfamiliar places.
000045|She discovered many a sunny, sleepy corner, fashioned to dream in.
000046|And she found it good to dream and to be alone and unmolested.
000047|There were days when she was unhappy, she did not know why, -- when it did not seem worth while to be glad or sorry, to be alive or dead;
000048|when life appeared to her like a grotesque pandemonium and humanity like worms struggling blindly toward inevitable annihilation.
