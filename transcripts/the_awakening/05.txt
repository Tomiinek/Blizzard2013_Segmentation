000001|They formed a congenial group sitting there that summer afternoon -- Madame Ratignolle sewing away, often stopping to relate a story or incident with much expressive gesture of her perfect hands;
000002|Robert and misess Pontellier sitting idle, exchanging occasional words, glances or smiles which indicated a certain advanced stage of intimacy and camaraderie.
000003|He had lived in her shadow during the past month.
000004|No one thought anything of it.
000005|Many had predicted that Robert would devote himself to misess Pontellier when he arrived.
000006|Since the age of fifteen, which was eleven years before, Robert each summer at Grand Isle had constituted himself the devoted attendant of some fair dame or damsel.
000007|Sometimes it was a young girl, again a widow;
000008|but as often as not it was some interesting married woman.
000009|For two consecutive seasons he lived in the sunlight of Mademoiselle Duvigne's presence.
000010|But she died between summers;
000011|then Robert posed as an inconsolable, prostrating himself at the feet of Madame Ratignolle for whatever crumbs of sympathy and comfort she might be pleased to vouchsafe.
000012|misess Pontellier liked to sit and gaze at her fair companion as she might look upon a faultless Madonna.
000013|"Could any one fathom the cruelty beneath that fair exterior?" murmured Robert.
000014|She knew that I adored her once, and she let me adore her.
000015|It was 'Robert, come;
000016|go;
000017|stand up;
000018|sit down;
000019|do this;
000020|do that;
000021|see if the baby sleeps;
000022|my thimble, please, that I left God knows where.
000023|Come and read Daudet to me while I sew.'
000024|Par exemple!
000025|I never had to ask.
000026|You were always there under my feet, like a troublesome cat.
000027|You mean like an adoring dog.
000028|And just as soon as Ratignolle appeared on the scene, then it was like a dog.
000029|'Passez! Adieu! Allez vous-en!'
000030|"Perhaps I feared to make Alphonse jealous," she interjoined, with excessive naivete.
000031|That made them all laugh.
000032|The right hand jealous of the left!
000033|The heart jealous of the soul!
000034|But for that matter, the Creole husband is never jealous;
000035|with him the gangrene passion is one which has become dwarfed by disuse.
000036|Meanwhile Robert, addressing misessPontellier, continued to tell of his one time hopeless passion for Madame Ratignolle;
000037|of sleepless nights, of consuming flames till the very sea sizzled when he took his daily plunge.
000038|While the lady at the needle kept up a little running, contemptuous comment:
000039|Blagueur -- farceur -- gros bete, va!
000040|He never assumed this seriocomic tone when alone with misess Pontellier.
000041|She never knew precisely what to make of it;
000042|at that moment it was impossible for her to guess how much of it was jest and what proportion was earnest.
000043|It was understood that he had often spoken words of love to Madame Ratignolle, without any thought of being taken seriously.
000044|misess Pontellier was glad he had not assumed a similar role toward herself.
000045|It would have been unacceptable and annoying.
000046|misess Pontellier had brought her sketching materials, which she sometimes dabbled with in an unprofessional way.
000047|She liked the dabbling.
000048|She felt in it satisfaction of a kind which no other employment afforded her.
000049|She had long wished to try herself on Madame Ratignolle.
000050|Never had that lady seemed a more tempting subject than at that moment, seated there like some sensuous Madonna, with the gleam of the fading day enriching her splendid color.
000051|Robert crossed over and seated himself upon the step below misess Pontellier, that he might watch her work.
000052|She handled her brushes with a certain ease and freedom which came, not from long and close acquaintance with them, but from a natural aptitude.
000053|Robert followed her work with close attention, giving forth little ejaculatory expressions of appreciation in French, which he addressed to Madame Ratignolle.
000054|Mais ce n'est pas mal!
000055|Elle s'y connait, elle a de la force, oui.
000056|During his oblivious attention he once quietly rested his head against misess Pontellier's arm.
000057|As gently she repulsed him.
000058|Once again he repeated the offense.
000059|She could not but believe it to be thoughtlessness on his part;
000060|yet that was no reason she should submit to it.
000061|She did not remonstrate, except again to repulse him quietly but firmly.
000062|He offered no apology.
000063|The picture completed bore no resemblance to Madame Ratignolle.
000064|She was greatly disappointed to find that it did not look like her.
000065|But it was a fair enough piece of work, and in many respects satisfying.
000066|misess Pontellier evidently did not think so.
000067|After surveying the sketch critically she drew a broad smudge of paint across its surface, and crumpled the paper between her hands.
000068|The youngsters came tumbling up the steps, the quadroon following at the respectful distance which they required her to observe.
000069|misess Pontellier made them carry her paints and things into the house.
000070|She sought to detain them for a little talk and some pleasantry.
000071|But they were greatly in earnest.
000072|They had only come to investigate the contents of the bonbon box.
000073|They accepted without murmuring what she chose to give them, each holding out two chubby hands scoop-like, in the vain hope that they might be filled;
000074|and then away they went.
000075|The sun was low in the west, and the breeze soft and languorous that came up from the south, charged with the seductive odor of the sea.
000076|Children freshly befurbelowed, were gathering for their games under the oaks.
000077|Their voices were high and penetrating.
000078|Madame Ratignolle folded her sewing, placing thimble, scissors, and thread all neatly together in the roll, which she pinned securely.
000079|She complained of faintness.
000080|misess Pontellier flew for the cologne water and a fan.
000081|She bathed Madame Ratignolle's face with cologne, while Robert plied the fan with unnecessary vigor.
000082|The spell was soon over, and misess Pontellier could not help wondering if there were not a little imagination responsible for its origin, for the rose tint had never faded from her friend's face.
000083|She stood watching the fair woman walk down the long line of galleries with the grace and majesty which queens are sometimes supposed to possess.
000084|Her little ones ran to meet her.
000085|Two of them clung about her white skirts, the third she took from its nurse and with a thousand endearments bore it along in her own fond, encircling arms.
000086|Though, as everybody well knew, the doctor had forbidden her to lift so much as a pin!
000087|"Are you going bathing?" asked Robert of misess Pontellier.
000088|It was not so much a question as a reminder.
000089|"Oh, no," she answered, with a tone of indecision.
000090|I'm tired;
000091|"I think not."
000092|Her glance wandered from his face away toward the Gulf, whose sonorous murmur reached her like a loving but imperative entreaty.
000093|"Oh, come!" he insisted.
000094|You mustn't miss your bath.
000095|Come on.
000096|The water must be delicious;
000097|it will not hurt you.
000098|Come.
000099|He reached up for her big, rough straw hat that hung on a peg outside the door, and put it on her head.
000100|They descended the steps, and walked away together toward the beach.
