000001|The dining-room was very small.
000002|Edna's round mahogany would have almost filled it.
000003|As it was there was but a step or two from the little table to the kitchen, to the mantel, the small buffet, and the side door that opened out on the narrow brick-paved yard.
000004|A certain degree of ceremony settled upon them with the announcement of dinner.
000005|There was no return to personalities.
000006|Robert related incidents of his sojourn in Mexico, and Edna talked of events likely to interest him, which had occurred during his absence.
000007|The dinner was of ordinary quality, except for the few delicacies which she had sent out to purchase.
000008|Old Celestine, with a bandana tignon twisted about her head, hobbled in and out, taking a personal interest in everything;
000009|and she lingered occasionally to talk patois with Robert, whom she had known as a boy.
000010|He went out to a neighboring cigar stand to purchase cigarette papers, and when he came back he found that Celestine had served the black coffee in the parlor.
000011|"Perhaps I shouldn't have come back," he said.
000012|When you are tired of me, tell me to go.
000013|You never tire me.
000014|You must have forgotten the hours and hours at Grand Isle in which we grew accustomed to each other and used to being together.
000015|"I have forgotten nothing at Grand Isle," he said, not looking at her, but rolling a cigarette.
000016|His tobacco pouch, which he laid upon the table, was a fantastic embroidered silk affair, evidently the handiwork of a woman.
000017|"You used to carry your tobacco in a rubber pouch," said Edna, picking up the pouch and examining the needlework.
000018|Yes; it was lost.
000019|Where did you buy this one?
000020|In Mexico?
000021|It was given to me by a Vera Cruz girl;
000022|"they are very generous," he replied, striking a match and lighting his cigarette.
000023|They are very handsome, I suppose, those Mexican women;
000024|very picturesque, with their black eyes and their lace scarfs.
000025|Some are;
000026|others are hideous, just as you find women everywhere.
000027|What was she like -- the one who gave you the pouch?
000028|You must have known her very well.
000029|She was very ordinary.
000030|She wasn't of the slightest importance.
000031|I knew her well enough.
000032|Did you visit at her house?
000033|Was it interesting?
000034|I should like to know and hear about the people you met, and the impressions they made on you.
000035|There are some people who leave impressions not so lasting as the imprint of an oar upon the water.
000036|Was she such a one?
000037|It would be ungenerous for me to admit that she was of that order and kind.
000038|He thrust the pouch back in his pocket, as if to put away the subject with the trifle which had brought it up.
000039|Arobin dropped in with a message from misess Merriman, to say that the card party was postponed on account of the illness of one of her children.
000040|"How do you do, Arobin?" said Robert, rising from the obscurity.
000041|Oh! Lebrun.
000042|To be sure!
000043|I heard yesterday you were back.
000044|How did they treat you down in Mexique?
000045|Fairly well.
000046|But not well enough to keep you there.
000047|Stunning girls, though, in Mexico.
000048|I thought I should never get away from Vera Cruz when I was down there a couple of years ago.
000049|"Did they embroider slippers and tobacco pouches and hat-bands and things for you?" asked Edna.
000050|Oh! my! no!
000051|I didn't get so deep in their regard.
000052|I fear they made more impression on me than I made on them.
000053|You were less fortunate than Robert, then.
000054|I am always less fortunate than Robert.
000055|Has he been imparting tender confidences?
000056|"I've been imposing myself long enough," said Robert, rising, and shaking hands with Edna.
000057|Please convey my regards to mister Pontellier when you write.
000058|He shook hands with Arobin and went away.
000059|"Fine fellow, that Lebrun," said Arobin when Robert had gone.
000060|I never heard you speak of him.
000061|"I knew him last summer at Grand Isle," she replied.
000062|Here is that photograph of yours.
000063|Don't you want it?
000064|What do I want with it?
000065|Throw it away.
000066|She threw it back on the table.
000067|"I'm not going to misess Merriman's," she said.
000068|If you see her, tell her so.
000069|But perhaps I had better write.
000070|I think I shall write now, and say that I am sorry her child is sick, and tell her not to count on me.
000071|"It would be a good scheme," acquiesced Arobin.
000072|I don't blame you;
000073|stupid lot!
000074|Edna opened the blotter, and having procured paper and pen, began to write the note.
000075|Arobin lit a cigar and read the evening paper, which he had in his pocket.
000076|"What is the date?" she asked.
000077|He told her.
000078|Will you mail this for me when you go out?
000079|Certainly.
000080|He read to her little bits out of the newspaper, while she straightened things on the table.
000081|"What do you want to do?" he asked, throwing aside the paper.
000082|Do you want to go out for a walk or a drive or anything?
000083|It would be a fine night to drive.
000084|No; I don't want to do anything but just be quiet.
000085|You go away and amuse yourself.
000086|Don't stay.
000087|I'll go away if I must;
000088|but I shan't amuse myself.
000089|You know that I only live when I am near you.
000090|He stood up to bid her good night.
000091|Is that one of the things you always say to women?
000092|"I have said it before, but I don't think I ever came so near meaning it," he answered with a smile.
000093|There were no warm lights in her eyes;
000094|only a dreamy, absent look.
000095|Good night.
000096|I adore you.
000097|"Sleep well," he said, and he kissed her hand and went away.
000098|She stayed alone in a kind of reverie -- a sort of stupor.
000099|Step by step she lived over every instant of the time she had been with Robert after he had entered Mademoiselle Reisz's door.
000100|She recalled his words, his looks.
000101|How few and meager they had been for her hungry heart!
000102|A vision -- a transcendently seductive vision of a Mexican girl arose before her.
000103|She writhed with a jealous pang.
000104|She wondered when he would come back.
000105|He had not said he would come back.
000106|She had been with him, had heard his voice and touched his hand.
