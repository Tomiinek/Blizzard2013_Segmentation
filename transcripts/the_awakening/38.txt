000001|Edna still felt dazed when she got outside in the open air.
000002|The Doctor's coupe had returned for him and stood before the porte cochere.
000003|She did not wish to enter the coupe, and told Doctor Mandelet she would walk;
000004|she was not afraid, and would go alone.
000005|He directed his carriage to meet him at misess Pontellier's, and he started to walk home with her.
000006|Up -- away up, over the narrow street between the tall houses, the stars were blazing.
000007|The air was mild and caressing, but cool with the breath of spring and the night.
000008|They walked slowly, the Doctor with a heavy, measured tread and his hands behind him;
000009|Edna, in an absent-minded way, as she had walked one night at Grand Isle, as if her thoughts had gone ahead of her and she was striving to overtake them.
000010|"You shouldn't have been there, misess Pontellier," he said.
000011|That was no place for you.
000012|Adele is full of whims at such times.
000013|There were a dozen women she might have had with her, unimpressionable women.
000014|I felt that it was cruel, cruel.
000015|You shouldn't have gone.
000016|"Oh, well!" she answered, indifferently.
000017|I don't know that it matters after all.
000018|One has to think of the children some time or other;
000019|the sooner the better.
000020|When is Leonce coming back?
000021|Quite soon.
000022|Some time in March.
000023|And you are going abroad?
000024|Perhaps -- no, I am not going.
000025|I'm not going to be forced into doing things.
000026|I don't want to go abroad.
000027|I want to be let alone.
000028|Nobody has any right -- except children, perhaps -- and even then, it seems to me -- or it did seem.
000029|She felt that her speech was voicing the incoherency of her thoughts, and stopped abruptly.
000030|"The trouble is," sighed the Doctor, grasping her meaning intuitively, "that youth is given up to illusions."
000031|It seems to be a provision of Nature;
000032|a decoy to secure mothers for the race.
000033|And Nature takes no account of moral consequences, of arbitrary conditions which we create, and which we feel obliged to maintain at any cost.
000034|"Yes," she said.
000035|The years that are gone seem like dreams -- if one might go on sleeping and dreaming -- but to wake up and find -- oh! well!
000036|perhaps it is better to wake up after all, even to suffer, rather than to remain a dupe to illusions all one's life.
000037|"It seems to me, my dear child," said the Doctor at parting, holding her hand, "you seem to me to be in trouble."
000038|I am not going to ask for your confidence.
000039|I will only say that if ever you feel moved to give it to me, perhaps I might help you.
000040|I know I would understand.
000041|And I tell you there are not many who would -- not many, my dear.
000042|Some way I don't feel moved to speak of things that trouble me.
000043|Don't think I am ungrateful or that I don't appreciate your sympathy.
000044|There are periods of despondency and suffering which take possession of me.
000045|But I don't want anything but my own way.
000046|That is wanting a good deal, of course, when you have to trample upon the lives, the hearts, the prejudices of others -- but no matter -- still, I shouldn't want to trample upon the little lives.
000047|Oh! I don't know what I'm saying, Doctor.
000048|Good night.
000049|Don't blame me for anything.
000050|Yes, I will blame you if you don't come and see me soon.
000051|We will talk of things you never have dreamt of talking about before.
000052|It will do us both good.
000053|I don't want you to blame yourself, whatever comes.
000054|Good night, my child.
000055|She let herself in at the gate, but instead of entering she sat upon the step of the porch.
000056|The night was quiet and soothing.
000057|All the tearing emotion of the last few hours seemed to fall away from her like a somber, uncomfortable garment, which she had but to loosen to be rid of.
000058|She went back to that hour before Adele had sent for her;
000059|and her senses kindled afresh in thinking of Robert's words, the pressure of his arms, and the feeling of his lips upon her own.
000060|She could picture at that moment no greater bliss on earth than possession of the beloved one.
000061|His expression of love had already given him to her in part.
000062|When she thought that he was there at hand, waiting for her, she grew numb with the intoxication of expectancy.
000063|It was so late;
000064|he would be asleep perhaps.
000065|She would awaken him with a kiss.
000066|She hoped he would be asleep that she might arouse him with her caresses.
000067|Still, she remembered Adele's voice whispering, "Think of the children;"
000068|"think of them." She meant to think of them;
000069|that determination had driven into her soul like a death wound -- but not to-night.
000070|To-morrow would be time to think of everything.
000071|Robert was not waiting for her in the little parlor.
000072|He was nowhere at hand.
000073|The house was empty.
000074|But he had scrawled on a piece of paper that lay in the lamplight:
000075|I love you.
000076|Good-by -- because I love you.
000077|Edna grew faint when she read the words.
000078|She went and sat on the sofa.
000079|Then she stretched herself out there, never uttering a sound.
000080|She did not sleep.
000081|She did not go to bed.
000082|The lamp sputtered and went out.
