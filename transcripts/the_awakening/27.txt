000001|"What is the matter with you?" asked Arobin that evening.
000002|I never found you in such a happy mood.
000003|Edna was tired by that time, and was reclining on the lounge before the fire.
000004|Don't you know the weather prophet has told us we shall see the sun pretty soon?
000005|"Well, that ought to be reason enough," he acquiesced.
000006|You wouldn't give me another if I sat here all night imploring you.
000007|He sat close to her on a low tabouret, and as he spoke his fingers lightly touched the hair that fell a little over her forehead.
000008|She liked the touch of his fingers through her hair, and closed her eyes sensitively.
000009|"One of these days," she said, "I'm going to pull myself together for a while and think -- try to determine what character of a woman I am;"
000010|for, candidly, I don't know.
000011|By all the codes which I am acquainted with, I am a devilishly wicked specimen of the sex.
000012|But some way I can't convince myself that I am.
000013|I must think about it.
000014|Don't.
000015|What's the use?
000016|Why should you bother thinking about it when I can tell you what manner of woman you are.
000017|His fingers strayed occasionally down to her warm, smooth cheeks and firm chin, which was growing a little full and double.
000018|Oh, yes!
000019|You will tell me that I am adorable;
000020|everything that is captivating.
000021|Spare yourself the effort.
000022|No;
000023|I shan't tell you anything of the sort, though I shouldn't be lying if I did.
000024|"Do you know Mademoiselle Reisz?" she asked irrelevantly.
000025|The pianist?
000026|I know her by sight.
000027|I've heard her play.
000028|She says queer things sometimes in a bantering way that you don't notice at the time and you find yourself thinking about afterward.
000029|For instance?
000030|Well, for instance, when I left her to-day, she put her arms around me and felt my shoulder blades, to see if my wings were strong, she said.
000031|'The bird that would soar above the level plain of tradition and prejudice must have strong wings.
000032|It is a sad spectacle to see the weaklings bruised, exhausted, fluttering back to earth.' Whither would you soar?
000033|I'm not thinking of any extraordinary flights.
000034|I only half comprehend her.
000035|"I've heard she's partially demented," said Arobin.
000036|"She seems to me wonderfully sane," Edna replied.
000037|I'm told she's extremely disagreeable and unpleasant.
000038|Why have you introduced her at a moment when I desired to talk of you?
000039|"Oh! talk of me if you like," cried Edna, clasping her hands beneath her head;
000040|but let me think of something else while you do.
000041|I'm jealous of your thoughts tonight.
000042|They're making you a little kinder than usual;
000043|but some way I feel as if they were wandering, as if they were not here with me.
000044|She only looked at him and smiled.
000045|His eyes were very near.
000046|He leaned upon the lounge with an arm extended across her, while the other hand still rested upon her hair.
000047|They continued silently to look into each other's eyes.
000048|When he leaned forward and kissed her, she clasped his head, holding his lips to hers.
000049|It was the first kiss of her life to which her nature had really responded.
