000001|"Well?" questioned Arobin, who had remained with Edna after the others had departed.
000002|"Well," she reiterated, and stood up, stretching her arms, and feeling the need to relax her muscles after having been so long seated.
000003|"What next?" he asked.
000004|The servants are all gone.
000005|They left when the musicians did.
000006|I have dismissed them.
000007|The house has to be closed and locked, and I shall trot around to the pigeon house, and shall send Celestine over in the morning to straighten things up.
000008|He looked around, and began to turn out some of the lights.
000009|"What about upstairs?" he inquired.
000010|I think it is all right;
000011|but there may be a window or two unlatched.
000012|We had better look;
000013|you might take a candle and see.
000014|And bring me my wrap and hat on the foot of the bed in the middle room.
000015|He went up with the light, and Edna began closing doors and windows.
000016|She hated to shut in the smoke and the fumes of the wine.
000017|Arobin found her cape and hat, which he brought down and helped her to put on.
000018|When everything was secured and the lights put out, they left through the front door, Arobin locking it and taking the key, which he carried for Edna.
000019|He helped her down the steps.
000020|"Will you have a spray of jessamine?" he asked, breaking off a few blossoms as he passed.
000021|No;
000022|I don't want anything.
000023|She seemed disheartened, and had nothing to say.
000024|She took his arm, which he offered her, holding up the weight of her satin train with the other hand.
000025|She looked down, noticing the black line of his leg moving in and out so close to her against the yellow shimmer of her gown.
000026|There was the whistle of a railway train somewhere in the distance, and the midnight bells were ringing.
000027|They met no one in their short walk.
000028|The "pigeon house" stood behind a locked gate, and a shallow parterre that had been somewhat neglected.
000029|There was a small front porch, upon which a long window and the front door opened.
000030|The door opened directly into the parlor;
000031|there was no side entry.
000032|Back in the yard was a room for servants, in which old Celestine had been ensconced.
000033|Edna had left a lamp burning low upon the table.
000034|She had succeeded in making the room look habitable and homelike.
000035|There were some books on the table and a lounge near at hand.
000036|On the floor was a fresh matting, covered with a rug or two;
000037|and on the walls hung a few tasteful pictures.
000038|But the room was filled with flowers.
000039|These were a surprise to her.
000040|Arobin had sent them, and had had Celestine distribute them during Edna's absence.
000041|Her bedroom was adjoining, and across a small passage were the dining-room and kitchen.
000042|Edna seated herself with every appearance of discomfort.
000043|"Are you tired?" he asked.
000044|Yes, and chilled, and miserable.
000045|I feel as if I had been wound up to a certain pitch -- too tight -- and something inside of me had snapped.
000046|She rested her head against the table upon her bare arm.
000047|"You want to rest," he said, "and to be quiet."
000048|I'll go;
000049|I'll leave you and let you rest.
000050|"Yes," she replied.
000051|He stood up beside her and smoothed her hair with his soft, magnetic hand.
000052|His touch conveyed to her a certain physical comfort.
000053|She could have fallen quietly asleep there if he had continued to pass his hand over her hair.
000054|He brushed the hair upward from the nape of her neck.
000055|"I hope you will feel better and happier in the morning," he said.
000056|You have tried to do too much in the past few days.
000057|The dinner was the last straw;
000058|you might have dispensed with it.
000059|"Yes," she admitted;
000060|it was stupid.
000061|No, it was delightful;
000062|but it has worn you out.
000063|His hand had strayed to her beautiful shoulders, and he could feel the response of her flesh to his touch.
000064|He seated himself beside her and kissed her lightly upon the shoulder.
000065|"I thought you were going away," she said, in an uneven voice.
000066|I am, after I have said good night.
000067|"Good night," she murmured.
000068|He did not answer, except to continue to caress her.
