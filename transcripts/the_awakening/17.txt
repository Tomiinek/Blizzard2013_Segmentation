000001|The Pontelliers possessed a very charming home on Esplanade Street in New Orleans.
000002|It was a large, double cottage, with a broad front veranda, whose round, fluted columns supported the sloping roof.
000003|The house was painted a dazzling white;
000004|the outside shutters, or jalousies, were green.
000005|In the yard, which was kept scrupulously neat, were flowers and plants of every description which flourishes in South Louisiana.
000006|Within doors the appointments were perfect after the conventional type.
000007|The softest carpets and rugs covered the floors;
000008|rich and tasteful draperies hung at doors and windows.
000009|There were paintings, selected with judgment and discrimination, upon the walls.
000010|The cut glass, the silver, the heavy damask which daily appeared upon the table were the envy of many women whose husbands were less generous than mister Pontellier.
000011|mister Pontellier was very fond of walking about his house examining its various appointments and details, to see that nothing was amiss.
000012|He greatly valued his possessions, chiefly because they were his, and derived genuine pleasure from contemplating a painting, a statuette, a rare lace curtain -- no matter what -- after he had bought it and placed it among his household gods.
000013|On Tuesday afternoons -- Tuesday being misess Pontellier's reception day -- there was a constant stream of callers -- women who came in carriages or in the street cars, or walked when the air was soft and distance permitted.
000014|A light-colored mulatto boy, in dress coat and bearing a diminutive silver tray for the reception of cards, admitted them.
000015|A maid, in white fluted cap, offered the callers liqueur, coffee, or chocolate, as they might desire.
000016|misess Pontellier, attired in a handsome reception gown, remained in the drawing-room the entire afternoon receiving her visitors.
000017|Men sometimes called in the evening with their wives.
000018|This had been the programme which misess Pontellier had religiously followed since her marriage, six years before.
000019|Certain evenings during the week she and her husband attended the opera or sometimes the play.
000020|mister Pontellier left his home in the mornings between nine and ten o'clock, and rarely returned before half-past six or seven in the evening -- dinner being served at half-past seven.
000021|He and his wife seated themselves at table one Tuesday evening, a few weeks after their return from Grand Isle.
000022|They were alone together.
000023|The boys were being put to bed;
000024|the patter of their bare, escaping feet could be heard occasionally, as well as the pursuing voice of the quadroon, lifted in mild protest and entreaty.
000025|misess Pontellier did not wear her usual Tuesday reception gown;
000026|she was in ordinary house dress.
000027|mister Pontellier, who was observant about such things, noticed it, as he served the soup and handed it to the boy in waiting.
000028|Tired out, Edna?
000029|Whom did you have?
000030|"Many callers?" he asked.
000031|He tasted his soup and began to season it with pepper, salt, vinegar, mustard -- everything within reach.
000032|"There were a good many," replied Edna, who was eating her soup with evident satisfaction.
000033|I found their cards when I got home;
000034|I was out.
000035|"Out!" exclaimed her husband, with something like genuine consternation in his voice as he laid down the vinegar cruet and looked at her through his glasses.
000036|Why, what could have taken you out on Tuesday?
000037|What did you have to do?
000038|Nothing.
000039|I simply felt like going out, and I went out.
000040|"Well, I hope you left some suitable excuse," said her husband, somewhat appeased, as he added a dash of cayenne pepper to the soup.
000041|No, I left no excuse.
000042|I told Joe to say I was out, that was all.
000043|Why, my dear, I should think you'd understand by this time that people don't do such things;
000044|we've got to observe les convenances if we ever expect to get on and keep up with the procession.
000045|If you felt that you had to leave home this afternoon, you should have left some suitable explanation for your absence.
000046|This soup is really impossible;
000047|it's strange that woman hasn't learned yet to make a decent soup.
000048|Any free-lunch stand in town serves a better one.
000049|Was misess Belthrop here?
000050|Bring the tray with the cards, Joe.
000051|I don't remember who was here.
000052|The boy retired and returned after a moment, bringing the tiny silver tray, which was covered with ladies' visiting cards.
000053|He handed it to misess Pontellier.
000054|"Give it to mister Pontellier," she said.
000055|Joe offered the tray to mister Pontellier, and removed the soup.
000056|mister Pontellier scanned the names of his wife's callers, reading some of them aloud, with comments as he read.
000057|'The Misses Delasidas.' I worked a big deal in futures for their father this morning;
000058|nice girls;
000059|it's time they were getting married.
000060|'misess Belthrop.' I tell you what it is, Edna;
000061|you can't afford to snub misess Belthrop.
000062|Why, Belthrop could buy and sell us ten times over.
000063|His business is worth a good, round sum to me.
000064|You'd better write her a note.
000065|'misess James Highcamp.' Hugh! the less you have to do with misess Highcamp, the better.
000066|'Madame Laforce.' Came all the way from Carrolton, too, poor old soul.
000067|"'Miss Wiggs,' 'misess Eleanor Boltons.'" He pushed the cards aside.
000068|"Mercy!" exclaimed Edna, who had been fuming.
000069|Why are you taking the thing so seriously and making such a fuss over it?
000070|I'm not making any fuss over it.
000071|But it's just such seeming trifles that we've got to take seriously;
000072|such things count.
000073|The fish was scorched.
000074|mister Pontellier would not touch it.
000075|Edna said she did not mind a little scorched taste.
000076|The roast was in some way not to his fancy, and he did not like the manner in which the vegetables were served.
000077|"It seems to me," he said, "we spend money enough in this house to procure at least one meal a day which a man could eat and retain his self-respect."
000078|"You used to think the cook was a treasure," returned Edna, indifferently.
000079|Perhaps she was when she first came;
000080|but cooks are only human.
000081|They need looking after, like any other class of persons that you employ.
000082|Suppose I didn't look after the clerks in my office, just let them run things their own way;
000083|they'd soon make a nice mess of me and my business.
000084|"Where are you going?" asked Edna, seeing that her husband arose from table without having eaten a morsel except a taste of the highly-seasoned soup."
000085|I'm going to get my dinner at the club.
000086|Good night.
000087|He went into the hall, took his hat and stick from the stand, and left the house.
000088|She was somewhat familiar with such scenes.
000089|They had often made her very unhappy.
000090|On a few previous occasions she had been completely deprived of any desire to finish her dinner.
000091|Sometimes she had gone into the kitchen to administer a tardy rebuke to the cook.
000092|Once she went to her room and studied the cookbook during an entire evening, finally writing out a menu for the week, which left her harassed with a feeling that, after all, she had accomplished no good that was worth the name.
000093|But that evening Edna finished her dinner alone, with forced deliberation.
000094|Her face was flushed and her eyes flamed with some inward fire that lighted them.
000095|After finishing her dinner she went to her room, having instructed the boy to tell any other callers that she was indisposed.
000096|It was a large, beautiful room, rich and picturesque in the soft, dim light which the maid had turned low.
000097|She went and stood at an open window and looked out upon the deep tangle of the garden below.
000098|All the mystery and witchery of the night seemed to have gathered there amid the perfumes and the dusky and tortuous outlines of flowers and foliage.
000099|She was seeking herself and finding herself in just such sweet, half-darkness which met her moods.
000100|But the voices were not soothing that came to her from the darkness and the sky above and the stars.
000101|They jeered and sounded mournful notes without promise, devoid even of hope.
000102|She turned back into the room and began to walk to and fro down its whole length without stopping, without resting.
000103|She carried in her hands a thin handkerchief, which she tore into ribbons, rolled into a ball, and flung from her.
000104|Once she stopped, and taking off her wedding ring, flung it upon the carpet.
000105|When she saw it lying there, she stamped her heel upon it, striving to crush it.
000106|But her small boot heel did not make an indenture, not a mark upon the little glittering circlet.
000107|In a sweeping passion she seized a glass vase from the table and flung it upon the tiles of the hearth.
000108|She wanted to destroy something.
000109|The crash and clatter were what she wanted to hear.
000110|A maid, alarmed at the din of breaking glass, entered the room to discover what was the matter.
000111|"A vase fell upon the hearth," said Edna.
000112|Never mind;
000113|leave it till morning.
000114|"Oh! you might get some of the glass in your feet, ma'am," insisted the young woman, picking up bits of the broken vase that were scattered upon the carpet.
000115|And here's your ring, ma'am, under the chair.
