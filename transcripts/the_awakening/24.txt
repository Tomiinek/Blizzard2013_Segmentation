000001|Edna and her father had a warm, and almost violent dispute upon the subject of her refusal to attend her sister's wedding.
000002|mister Pontellier declined to interfere, to interpose either his influence or his authority.
000003|He was following Doctor Mandelet's advice, and letting her do as she liked.
000004|The Colonel reproached his daughter for her lack of filial kindness and respect, her want of sisterly affection and womanly consideration.
000005|His arguments were labored and unconvincing.
000006|He doubted if Janet would accept any excuse -- forgetting that Edna had offered none.
000007|He doubted if Janet would ever speak to her again, and he was sure Margaret would not.
000008|Edna was glad to be rid of her father when he finally took himself off with his wedding garments and his bridal gifts, with his padded shoulders, his Bible reading, his "toddies" and ponderous oaths.
000009|mister Pontellier followed him closely.
000010|He meant to stop at the wedding on his way to New York and endeavor by every means which money and love could devise to atone somewhat for Edna's incomprehensible action.
000011|"You are too lenient, too lenient by far, Leonce," asserted the Colonel.
000012|Authority, coercion are what is needed.
000013|Put your foot down good and hard;
000014|the only way to manage a wife.
000015|Take my word for it.
000016|The Colonel was perhaps unaware that he had coerced his own wife into her grave.
000017|mister Pontellier had a vague suspicion of it which he thought it needless to mention at that late day.
000018|Edna was not so consciously gratified at her husband's leaving home as she had been over the departure of her father.
000019|As the day approached when he was to leave her for a comparatively long stay, she grew melting and affectionate, remembering his many acts of consideration and his repeated expressions of an ardent attachment.
000020|She was solicitous about his health and his welfare.
000021|She bustled around, looking after his clothing, thinking about heavy underwear, quite as Madame Ratignolle would have done under similar circumstances.
000022|She cried when he went away, calling him her dear, good friend, and she was quite certain she would grow lonely before very long and go to join him in New York.
000023|But after all, a radiant peace settled upon her when she at last found herself alone.
000024|Even the children were gone.
000025|Old Madame Pontellier had come herself and carried them off to Iberville with their quadroon.
000026|The old madame did not venture to say she was afraid they would be neglected during Leonce's absence;
000027|she hardly ventured to think so.
000028|She was hungry for them -- even a little fierce in her attachment.
000029|She did not want them to be wholly "children of the pavement," she always said when begging to have them for a space.
000030|She wished them to know the country, with its streams, its fields, its woods, its freedom, so delicious to the young.
000031|She wished them to taste something of the life their father had lived and known and loved when he, too, was a little child.
000032|When Edna was at last alone, she breathed a big, genuine sigh of relief.
000033|A feeling that was unfamiliar but very delicious came over her.
000034|She walked all through the house, from one room to another, as if inspecting it for the first time.
000035|She tried the various chairs and lounges, as if she had never sat and reclined upon them before.
000036|And she perambulated around the outside of the house, investigating, looking to see if windows and shutters were secure and in order.
000037|The flowers were like new acquaintances;
000038|she approached them in a familiar spirit, and made herself at home among them.
000039|The garden walks were damp, and Edna called to the maid to bring out her rubber sandals.
000040|And there she stayed, and stooped, digging around the plants, trimming, picking dead, dry leaves.
000041|The children's little dog came out, interfering, getting in her way.
000042|She scolded him, laughed at him, played with him.
000043|The garden smelled so good and looked so pretty in the afternoon sunlight.
000044|Edna plucked all the bright flowers she could find, and went into the house with them, she and the little dog.
000045|Even the kitchen assumed a sudden interesting character which she had never before perceived.
000046|She went in to give directions to the cook, to say that the butcher would have to bring much less meat, that they would require only half their usual quantity of bread, of milk and groceries.
000047|She told the cook that she herself would be greatly occupied during mister Pontellier's absence, and she begged her to take all thought and responsibility of the larder upon her own shoulders.
000048|That night Edna dined alone.
000049|The candelabra, with a few candles in the center of the table, gave all the light she needed.
000050|Outside the circle of light in which she sat, the large dining-room looked solemn and shadowy.
000051|The cook, placed upon her mettle, served a delicious repast -- a luscious tenderloin broiled a point.
000052|The wine tasted good;
000053|the marron glace seemed to be just what she wanted.
000054|It was so pleasant, too, to dine in a comfortable peignoir.
000055|She thought a little sentimentally about Leonce and the children, and wondered what they were doing.
000056|As she gave a dainty scrap or two to the doggie, she talked intimately to him about Etienne and Raoul.
000057|He was beside himself with astonishment and delight over these companionable advances, and showed his appreciation by his little quick, snappy barks and a lively agitation.
000058|Then Edna sat in the library after dinner and read Emerson until she grew sleepy.
000059|She realized that she had neglected her reading, and determined to start anew upon a course of improving studies, now that her time was completely her own to do with as she liked.
000060|After a refreshing bath, Edna went to bed.
