000001|Some people contended that the reason Mademoiselle Reisz always chose apartments up under the roof was to discourage the approach of beggars, peddlars and callers.
000002|There were plenty of windows in her little front room.
000003|They were for the most part dingy, but as they were nearly always open it did not make so much difference.
000004|They often admitted into the room a good deal of smoke and soot;
000005|but at the same time all the light and air that there was came through them.
000006|From her windows could be seen the crescent of the river, the masts of ships and the big chimneys of the Mississippi steamers.
000007|A magnificent piano crowded the apartment.
000008|In the next room she slept, and in the third and last she harbored a gasoline stove on which she cooked her meals when disinclined to descend to the neighboring restaurant.
000009|It was there also that she ate, keeping her belongings in a rare old buffet, dingy and battered from a hundred years of use.
000010|When Edna knocked at Mademoiselle Reisz's front room door and entered, she discovered that person standing beside the window, engaged in mending or patching an old prunella gaiter.
000011|The little musician laughed all over when she saw Edna.
000012|Her laugh consisted of a contortion of the face and all the muscles of the body.
000013|She seemed strikingly homely, standing there in the afternoon light.
000014|She still wore the shabby lace and the artificial bunch of violets on the side of her head.
000015|"So you remembered me at last," said Mademoiselle.
000016|I had said to myself, 'Ah, bah! she will never come.'
000017|"Did you want me to come?" asked Edna with a smile.
000018|"I had not thought much about it," answered Mademoiselle.
000019|The two had seated themselves on a little bumpy sofa which stood against the wall.
000020|I am glad, however, that you came.
000021|I have the water boiling back there, and was just about to make some coffee.
000022|You will drink a cup with me.
000023|And how is la belle dame?
000024|Always handsome!
000025|always healthy!
000026|always contented!
000027|She took Edna's hand between her strong wiry fingers, holding it loosely without warmth, and executing a sort of double theme upon the back and palm.
000028|"Yes," she went on;
000029|I sometimes thought: 'She will never come.
000030|She promised as those women in society always do, without meaning it.
000031|She will not come.' For I really don't believe you like me, misess Pontellier.
000032|"I don't know whether I like you or not," replied Edna, gazing down at the little woman with a quizzical look.
000033|The candor of misess Pontellier's admission greatly pleased Mademoiselle Reisz.
000034|She expressed her gratification by repairing forthwith to the region of the gasoline stove and rewarding her guest with the promised cup of coffee.
000035|The coffee and the biscuit accompanying it proved very acceptable to Edna, who had declined refreshment at Madame Lebrun's and was now beginning to feel hungry.
000036|Mademoiselle set the tray which she brought in upon a small table near at hand, and seated herself once again on the lumpy sofa.
000037|"I have had a letter from your friend," she remarked, as she poured a little cream into Edna's cup and handed it to her.
000038|My friend?
000039|Yes, your friend Robert.
000040|He wrote to me from the City of Mexico.
000041|"Wrote to you?" repeated Edna in amazement, stirring her coffee absently.
000042|Yes, to me.
000043|Why not?
000044|Don't stir all the warmth out of your coffee;
000045|drink it.
000046|Though the letter might as well have been sent to you;
000047|it was nothing but misess Pontellier from beginning to end.
000048|"Let me see it," requested the young woman, entreatingly.
000049|No;
000050|a letter concerns no one but the person who writes it and the one to whom it is written.
000051|Haven't you just said it concerned me from beginning to end?
000052|It was written about you, not to you.
000053|'Have you seen misess Pontellier?
000054|How is she looking?' he asks.
000055|'As misess Pontellier says,' or 'as misess Pontellier once said.' 'If misess Pontellier should call upon you, play for her that Impromptu of Chopin's, my favorite.
000056|I heard it here a day or two ago, but not as you play it.
000057|I should like to know how it affects her,' and so on, as if he supposed we were constantly in each other's society.
000058|Let me see the letter.
000059|Oh, no.
000060|Have you answered it?
000061|No.
000062|Let me see the letter.
000063|No, and again, no.
000064|Then play the Impromptu for me.
000065|It is growing late;
000066|what time do you have to be home?
000067|Time doesn't concern me.
000068|Your question seems a little rude.
000069|Play the Impromptu.
000070|But you have told me nothing of yourself.
000071|What are you doing?
000072|"Painting!" laughed Edna.
000073|I am becoming an artist.
000074|Think of it!
000075|Ah! an artist!
000076|You have pretensions, Madame.
000077|Why pretensions?
000078|Do you think I could not become an artist?
000079|I do not know you well enough to say.
000080|I do not know your talent or your temperament.
000081|To be an artist includes much;
000082|one must possess many gifts -- absolute gifts -- which have not been acquired by one's own effort.
000083|And, moreover, to succeed, the artist must possess the courageous soul.
000084|What do you mean by the courageous soul?
000085|Courageous, ma foi!
000086|The brave soul.
000087|The soul that dares and defies.
000088|Show me the letter and play for me the Impromptu.
000089|You see that I have persistence.
000090|Does that quality count for anything in art?
000091|"It counts with a foolish old woman whom you have captivated," replied Mademoiselle, with her wriggling laugh.
000092|The letter was right there at hand in the drawer of the little table upon which Edna had just placed her coffee cup.
000093|Mademoiselle opened the drawer and drew forth the letter, the topmost one.
000094|She placed it in Edna's hands, and without further comment arose and went to the piano.
000095|Mademoiselle played a soft interlude.
000096|It was an improvisation.
000097|She sat low at the instrument, and the lines of her body settled into ungraceful curves and angles that gave it an appearance of deformity.
000098|Gradually and imperceptibly the interlude melted into the soft opening minor chords of the Chopin Impromptu.
000099|Edna did not know when the Impromptu began or ended.
000100|She sat in the sofa corner reading Robert's letter by the fading light.
000101|Mademoiselle had glided from the Chopin into the quivering love notes of Isolde's song, and back again to the Impromptu with its soulful and poignant longing.
000102|The shadows deepened in the little room.
000103|The music grew strange and fantastic -- turbulent, insistent, plaintive and soft with entreaty.
000104|The shadows grew deeper.
000105|The music filled the room.
000106|It floated out upon the night, over the housetops, the crescent of the river, losing itself in the silence of the upper air.
000107|Edna was sobbing, just as she had wept one midnight at Grand Isle when strange, new voices awoke in her.
000108|She arose in some agitation to take her departure.
000109|"May I come again, Mademoiselle?" she asked at the threshold.
000110|Come whenever you feel like it.
000111|Be careful;
000112|the stairs and landings are dark;
000113|don't stumble.
000114|Mademoiselle reentered and lit a candle.
000115|Robert's letter was on the floor.
000116|She stooped and picked it up.
000117|It was crumpled and damp with tears.
