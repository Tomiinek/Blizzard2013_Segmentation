000001|Misess Pontellier's eyes were quick and bright;
000002|they were a yellowish brown, about the color of her hair.
000003|She had a way of turning them swiftly upon an object and holding them there as if lost in some inward maze of contemplation or thought.
000004|Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair.
000005|They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes.
000006|She was rather handsome than beautiful.
000007|Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features.
000008|Her manner was engaging.
000009|Robert rolled a cigarette.
000010|He smoked cigarettes because he could not afford cigars, he said.
000011|He had a cigar in his pocket which mister Pontellier had presented him with, and he was saving it for his after-dinner smoke.
000012|This seemed quite proper and natural on his part.
000013|In coloring he was not unlike his companion.
000014|A clean-shaved face made the resemblance more pronounced than it would otherwise have been.
000015|There rested no shadow of care upon his open countenance.
000016|His eyes gathered in and reflected the light and languor of the summer day.
000017|misess Pontellier reached over for a palm-leaf fan that lay on the porch and began to fan herself, while Robert sent between his lips light puffs from his cigarette.
000018|They chatted incessantly: about the things around them;
000019|their amusing adventure out in the water -- it had again assumed its entertaining aspect;
000020|about the wind, the trees, the people who had gone to the Cheniere;
000021|about the children playing croquet under the oaks, and the Farival twins, who were now performing the overture to "The Poet and the Peasant."
000022|Robert talked a good deal about himself.
000023|He was very young, and did not know any better.
000024|misess Pontellier talked a little about herself for the same reason.
000025|Each was interested in what the other said.
000026|Robert spoke of his intention to go to Mexico in the autumn, where fortune awaited him.
000027|He was always intending to go to Mexico, but some way never got there.
000028|Meanwhile he held on to his modest position in a mercantile house in New Orleans, where an equal familiarity with English, French and Spanish gave him no small value as a clerk and correspondent.
000029|He was spending his summer vacation, as he always did, with his mother at Grand Isle.
000030|In former times, before Robert could remember, "the house" had been a summer luxury of the Lebruns.
000031|Now, flanked by its dozen or more cottages, which were always filled with exclusive visitors from the "Quartier Francais," it enabled Madame Lebrun to maintain the easy and comfortable existence which appeared to be her birthright.
000032|misess Pontellier talked about her father's Mississippi plantation and her girlhood home in the old Kentucky bluegrass country.
000033|She was an American woman, with a small infusion of French which seemed to have been lost in dilution.
000034|She read a letter from her sister, who was away in the East, and who had engaged herself to be married.
000035|Robert was interested, and wanted to know what manner of girls the sisters were, what the father was like, and how long the mother had been dead.
000036|When misess Pontellier folded the letter it was time for her to dress for the early dinner.
000037|"I see Leonce isn't coming back," she said, with a glance in the direction whence her husband had disappeared.
000038|Robert supposed he was not, as there were a good many New Orleans club men over at Klein's.
