000001|misess Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him;
000002|for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.
000003|Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder.
000004|He received the kindest welcome from her;
000005|and shyness, coldness, reserve could not stand against such a reception.
000006|They had begun to fail him before he entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of misess Dashwood.
000007|Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her;
000008|and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself.
000009|His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible.
000010|He was not in spirits, however;
000011|he praised their house, admired its prospect, was attentive, and kind;
000012|but still he was not in spirits.
000013|The whole family perceived it, and misess Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents.
000014|"What are misess Ferrars's views for you at present, Edward?" said she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire;
000015|are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself?
000016|No.
000017|I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life!
000018|But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family;
000019|and with no inclination for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter.
000020|I shall not attempt it.
000021|I have no wish to be distinguished;
000022|and have every reason to hope I never shall.
000023|Thank Heaven!
000024|I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence.
000025|You have no ambition, I well know.
000026|Your wishes are all moderate.
000027|As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe.
000028|I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy;
000029|but, like every body else it must be in my own way.
000030|Greatness will not make me so.
000031|"Strange that it would!" cried Marianne.
000032|What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?
000033|"Grandeur has but little," said Elinor, "but wealth has much to do with it."
000034|"Elinor, for shame!" said Marianne, "money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it."
000035|Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.
000036|"Perhaps," said Elinor, smiling, "we may come to the same point."
000037|your competence and my wealth are very much alike, I dare say;
000038|and without them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting.
000039|Your ideas are only more noble than mine.
000040|Come, what is your competence?
000041|About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year;
000042|not more than that.
000043|Elinor laughed.
000044|two thousand a year! one is my wealth! I guessed how it would end.
000045|"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income," said Marianne.
000046|A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller.
000047|I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands.
000048|A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less.
000049|Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna.
000050|"Hunters!" repeated Edward -- "but why must you have hunters?"
000051|Every body does not hunt.
000052|Marianne coloured as she replied, "But most people do."
000053|"I wish," said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, "that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece!"
000054|"Oh that they would!" cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness.
000055|"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose," said Elinor, "in spite of the insufficiency of wealth."
000056|"Oh dear!" cried Margaret, "how happy I should be!"
000057|I wonder what I should do with it!
000058|Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.
000059|"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself," said misess Dashwood, "if my children were all to be rich without my help."
000060|"You must begin your improvements on this house," observed Elinor, "and your difficulties will soon vanish."
000061|"What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London," said Edward, "in such an event!"
000062|What a happy day for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops!
000063|You, Miss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you -- and as for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough in London to content her.
000064|And books! -- Thomson, Cowper, Scott -- she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands;
000065|and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree.
000066|Should not you, Marianne?
000067|Forgive me, if I am very saucy.
000068|But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes.
000069|I love to be reminded of the past, Edward -- whether it be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it -- and you will never offend me by talking of former times.
000070|You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent -- some of it, at least -- my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books.
000071|And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs.
000072|No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.
000073|Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life -- your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?
000074|Undoubtedly.
000075|At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.
000076|It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.
000077|"Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see," said Elinor, "she is not at all altered."
000078|She is only grown a little more grave than she was.
000079|"Nay, Edward," said Marianne, "you need not reproach me."
000080|You are not very gay yourself.
000081|"Why should you think so!" replied he, with a sigh.
000082|But gaiety never was a part of my character.
000083|"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's," said Elinor;
000084|I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest, very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry.
000085|"I believe you are right," he replied, "and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl."
000086|"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes," said Elinor, "in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated."
000087|Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them, without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.
000088|"But I thought it was right, Elinor," said Marianne, "to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people."
000089|I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours.
000090|This has always been your doctrine, I am sure.
000091|No, Marianne, never.
000092|My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding.
000093|All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour.
000094|You must not confound my meaning.
000095|I am guilty, I confess, of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention;
000096|but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?
000097|"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility," said Edward to Elinor.
000098|Do you gain no ground?
000099|"Quite the contrary," replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.
000100|"My judgment," he returned, "is all on your side of the question;"
000101|but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister's.
000102|I never wish to offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.
000103|I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!
000104|"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers," said Elinor.
000105|"She knows her own worth too well for false shame," replied Edward.
000106|Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other.
000107|If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not be shy.
000108|"But you would still be reserved," said Marianne, "and that is worse."
000109|Edward started -- "Reserved!"
000110|Am I reserved, Marianne?
000111|Yes, very.
000112|"I do not understand you," replied he, colouring.
000113|Reserved! -- how, in what manner?
000114|What am I to tell you?
000115|What can you suppose?
000116|Elinor looked surprised at his emotion;
000117|but trying to laugh off the subject, she said to him, "Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means?"
000118|Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?
000119|Edward made no answer.
