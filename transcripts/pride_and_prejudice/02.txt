000001|mister Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mister Bingley.
000002|He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go;
000003|and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.
000004|It was then disclosed in the following manner.
000005|Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:
000006|I hope mister Bingley will like it, Lizzy.
000007|"We are not in a way to know what mister Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."
000008|"But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that misess Long promised to introduce him."
000009|I do not believe misess Long will do any such thing.
000010|She has two nieces of her own.
000011|She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.
000012|"No more have I," said mister Bennet;
000013|and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.
000014|Misess Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
000015|Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake!
000016|Have a little compassion on my nerves.
000017|You tear them to pieces.
000018|"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father;
000019|she times them ill.
000020|"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.
000021|When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?
000022|To-morrow fortnight.
000023|"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and misess Long does not come back till the day before;"
000024|so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.
000025|Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce mister Bingley to her.
000026|Impossible, mister Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself;
000027|how can you be so teasing?
000028|I honour your circumspection.
000029|A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.
000030|One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.
000031|But if we do not venture somebody else will;
000032|and after all, misess Long and her neices must stand their chance;
000033|and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.
000034|The girls stared at their father.
000035|Misess Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"
000036|"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he.
000037|Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?
000038|I cannot quite agree with you there.
000039|What say you, Mary?
000040|For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.
000041|Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
000042|"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to mister Bingley."
000043|"I am sick of mister Bingley," cried his wife.
000044|I am sorry to hear that;
000045|but why did not you tell me that before?
000046|If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him.
000047|It is very unlucky;
000048|but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.
000049|The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished;
000050|that of misess Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest;
000051|though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.
000052|How good it was in you, my dear mister Bennet!
000053|But I knew I should persuade you at last.
000054|I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.
000055|Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now.
000056|"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said mister Bennet;
000057|and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
000058|"What an excellent father you have, girls!" said she, when the door was shut.
000059|I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
000060|or me, either, for that matter.
000061|At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day;
000062|but for your sakes, we would do anything.
000063|Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say mister Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.
000064|"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid;"
000065|for though I am the youngest, I'm the tallest.
