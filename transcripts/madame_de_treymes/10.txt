000001|There was another pause, during which Durham tried to steady himself against the shock of the impending revelation.
000002|It was an odd circumstance of the case that, though Madame de Treymes' avowal of duplicity was fresh in his ears, he did not for a moment believe that she would deceive him again.
000003|Whatever passed between them now would go to the root of the matter.
000004|The first thing that passed was the long look they exchanged: searching on his part, tender, sad, undefinable on hers.
000005|As the result of it he said: "Why, then, did you consent to the divorce?"
000006|"To get the boy back," she answered instantly;
000007|and while he sat stunned by the unexpectedness of the retort, she went on: "Is it possible you never suspected?"
000008|It has been our whole thought from the first.
000009|Everything was planned with that object.
000010|He drew a sharp breath of alarm.
000011|But the divorce -- how could that give him back to you?
000012|It was the only thing that could.
000013|We trembled lest the idea should occur to you.
000014|But we were reasonably safe, for there has only been one other case of the same kind before the courts.
000015|She leaned back, the sight of his perplexity checking her quick rush of words.
000016|"You didn't know," she began again, "that in that case, on the remarriage of the mother, the courts instantly restored the child to the father, though he had -- well, given as much cause for divorce as my unfortunate brother?"
000017|Durham gave an ironic laugh.
000018|Your French justice takes a grammar and dictionary to understand.
000019|She smiled.
000020|We understand it -- and it isn't necessary that you should.
000021|"So it would appear!" he exclaimed bitterly.
000022|Don't judge us too harshly -- or not, at least, till you have taken the trouble to learn our point of view.
000023|You consider the individual -- we think only of the family.
000024|Why don't you take care to preserve it, then?
000025|Ah, that's what we do;
000026|in spite of every aberration of the individual.
000027|And so, when we saw it was impossible that my brother and his wife should live together, we simply transferred our allegiance to the child -- we constituted him the family.
000028|A precious kindness you did him!
000029|If the result is to give him back to his father.
000030|That, I admit, is to be deplored;
000031|but his father is only a fraction of the whole.
000032|What we really do is to give him back to his race, his religion, his true place in the order of things.
000033|His mother never tried to deprive him of any of those inestimable advantages!
000034|Madame de Treymes unclasped her hands with a slight gesture of deprecation.
000035|Not consciously, perhaps;
000036|but silences and reserves can teach so much.
000037|His mother has another point of view
000038|"Thank heaven!" Durham interjected.
000039|Thank heaven for her -- yes -- perhaps;
000040|but it would not have done for the boy.
000041|Durham squared his shoulders with the sudden resolve of a man breaking through a throng of ugly phantoms.
000042|You haven't yet convinced me that it won't have to do for him.
000043|At the time of Madame de Malrive's separation, the court made no difficulty about giving her the custody of her son;
000044|and you must pardon me for reminding you that the father's unfitness was the reason alleged.
000045|Madame de Treymes shrugged her shoulders.
000046|And my poor brother, you would add, has not changed;
000047|but the circumstances have, and that proves precisely what I have been trying to show you: that, in such cases, the general course of events is considered, rather than the action of any one person.
000048|Then why is Madame de Malrive's action to be considered?
000049|Because it breaks up the unity of the family.
000050|"Unity -- !" broke from Durham;
000051|and Madame de Treymes gently suffered his smile.
000052|Of the family tradition, I mean: it introduces new elements.
000053|You are a new element.
000054|"Thank heaven!" said Durham again.
000055|She looked at him singularly.
000056|Yes -- you may thank heaven.
000057|Why isn't it enough to satisfy Fanny?
000058|Why isn't what enough?
000059|Your being, as I say, a new element;
000060|taking her so completely into a better air.
000061|Why shouldn't she be content to begin a new life with you, without wanting to keep the boy too?
000062|Durham stared at her dumbly.
000063|"I don't know what you mean," he said at length.
000064|"I mean that in her place -- " she broke off, dropping her eyes.
000065|She may have another son -- the son of the man she adores.
000066|Durham rose from his seat and took a quick turn through the room.
000067|She sat motionless, following his steps through her lowered lashes, which she raised again slowly as he stood before her.
000068|"Your idea, then, is that I should tell her nothing?" he said.
000069|Tell her now?
000070|But, my poor friend, you would be ruined!
000071|Exactly.
000072|He paused.
000073|Then why have you told me?
000074|Under her dark skin he saw the faint colour stealing.
000075|We see things so differently -- but can't you conceive that, after all that has passed, I felt it a kind of loyalty not to leave you in ignorance?
000076|And you feel no such loyalty to her?
000077|"Ah, I leave her to you," she murmured, looking down again.
000078|Durham continued to stand before her, grappling slowly with his perplexity, which loomed larger and darker as it closed in on him.
000079|You don't leave her to me;
000080|you take her from me at a stroke!
000081|"I suppose," he added painfully, "I ought to thank you for doing it before it's too late."
000082|She stared.
000083|I take her from you?
000084|I simply prevent your going to her unprepared.
000085|Knowing Fanny as I do, it seemed to me necessary that you should find a way in advance -- a way of tiding over the first moment.
000086|That, of course, is what we had planned that you shouldn't have.
000087|We meant to let you marry, and then -- .
000088|Oh, there is no question about the result: we are certain of our case -- our measures have been taken de loin.
000089|She broke off, as if oppressed by his stricken silence.
000090|You will think me stupid, but my warning you of this is the only return I know how to make for your generosity.
000091|I could not bear to have you say afterward that I had deceived you twice.
000092|"Twice?" He looked at her perplexedly, and her colour rose.
000093|I deceived you once -- that night at your cousin's, when I tried to get you to bribe me.
000094|Even then we meant to consent to the divorce -- it was decided the first day that I saw you.
000095|He was silent, and she added, with one of her mocking gestures: "You see from what a milieu you are taking her!"
000096|Durham groaned.
000097|She will never give up her son!
000098|How can she help it?
000099|After you are married there will be no choice.
000100|No -- but there is one now.
000101|Now?
000102|She sprang to her feet, clasping her hands in dismay.
000103|Haven't I made it clear to you?
000104|Haven't I shown you your course?
000105|She paused, and then brought out with emphasis: "I love Fanny, and I am ready to trust her happiness to you."
000106|"I shall have nothing to do with her happiness," he repeated doggedly.
000107|She stood close to him, with a look intently fixed on his face.
000108|"Are you afraid?" she asked with one of her mocking flashes.
000109|Afraid?
000110|Of not being able to make it up to her -- ?
000111|Their eyes met, and he returned her look steadily.
000112|No;
000113|if I had the chance, I believe I could.
000114|"I know you could!" she exclaimed.
000115|"That's the worst of it," he said with a cheerless laugh.
000116|The worst -- ?
000117|Don't you see that I can't deceive her?
000118|Can't trick her into marrying me now?
000119|Madame de Treymes continued to hold his eyes for a puzzled moment after he had spoken;
000120|then she broke out despairingly: "Is happiness never more to you, then, than this abstract standard of truth?"
000121|Durham reflected.
000122|I don't know -- it's an instinct.
000123|There doesn't seem to be any choice.
000124|Then I am a miserable wretch for not holding my tongue!
000125|He shook his head sadly.
000126|That would not have helped me;
000127|and it would have been a thousand times worse for her.
000128|Nothing can be as bad for her as losing you!
000129|Aren't you moved by seeing her need?
000130|"Horribly -- are not you?" he said, lifting his eyes to hers suddenly.
000131|She started under his look.
000132|You mean, why don't I help you?
000133|Why don't I use my influence?
000134|Ah, if you knew how I have tried!
000135|And you are sure that nothing can be done?
000136|Nothing, nothing: what arguments can I use?
000137|We abhor divorce -- we go against our religion in consenting to it -- and nothing short of recovering the boy could possibly justify us.
000138|Durham turned slowly away.
000139|"Then there is nothing to be done," he said, speaking more to himself than to her.
000140|He felt her light touch on his arm.
000141|Wait!
000142|There is one thing more --
000143|She stood close to him, with entreaty written on her small passionate face.
000144|"There is one thing more," she repeated.
000145|And that is, to believe that I am deceiving you again.
000146|He stopped short with a bewildered stare.
000147|That you are deceiving me -- about the boy?
000148|Yes -- yes;
000149|why shouldn't I?
000150|You're so credulous -- the temptation is irresistible.
000151|Ah, it would be too easy to find out
000152|Don't try, then!
000153|Go on as if nothing had happened.
000154|"I have been lying to you," she declared with vehemence.
000155|"Do you give me your word of honour?" he rejoined.
000156|A liar's?
000157|I haven't any!
000158|Take the logic of the facts instead.
000159|What reason have you to believe any good of me?
000160|And what reason have I to do any to you?
000161|Why on earth should I betray my family for your benefit?
000162|Ah, don't let yourself be deceived to the end!
000163|She sparkled up at him, her eyes suffused with mockery;
000164|but on the lashes he saw a tear.
000165|He shook his head sadly.
000166|I should first have to find a reason for your deceiving me.
000167|Why, I gave it to you long ago.
000168|I wanted to punish you -- and now I've punished you enough.
000169|"Yes, you've punished me enough," he conceded.
000170|The tear gathered and fell down her thin cheek.
000171|It's you who are punishing me now.
000172|I tell you I'm false to the core.
000173|Look back and see what I've done to you!
000174|He stood silent, with his eyes fixed on the ground.
000175|Then he took one of her hands and raised it to his lips.
000176|"You poor, good woman!" he said gravely.
000177|Her hand trembled as she drew it away.
000178|You're going to her -- straight from here?
000179|Yes -- straight from here.
000180|To tell her everything -- to renounce your hope?
000181|That is what it amounts to, I suppose.
000182|She watched him cross the room and lay his hand on the door.
