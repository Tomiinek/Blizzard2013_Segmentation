000001|troy wandered along towards the south.
000002|A composite feeling, made up of disgust with the, to him, humdrum tediousness of a farmer's life, gloomily images of her who lay in the churchyard, remorse, and a general averseness to his wife's society, impelled him to seek a home in any place on earth save Weatherbury.
000003|The sad accessories of Fanny's end confronted him as vivid pictures which threatened to be indelible, and made life in Bathsheba's house intolerable.
000004|At three in the afternoon he found himself at the foot of a slope more than a mile in length, which ran to the ridge of a range of hills lying parallel with the shore, and forming a monotonous barrier between the basin of cultivated country inland and the wilder scenery of the coast.
000005|Up the hill stretched a road nearly straight and perfectly white, the two sides approaching each other in a gradual taper till they met the sky at the top about two miles off.
000006|Through- out the length of this narrow and irksome inclined plane not a sign of life was visible on this garish afternoon Troy toiled up the road with a languor and depression greater than any he had experienced for many a day and year before.
000007|The air was warm and muggy, and the top seemed to recede as he approached.
000008|At last he reached the summit, and a wide and novel prospect burst upon him with an effect almost like that of the Pacific upon Balboa's gaze.
000009|The broad steely sea, marked only by faint lines, which had a semblance of being etched thereon to a degree not deep enough to disturb its general evenness, stretched the whole width of his front and round to the right, where, near the town and port of Budmouth, the sun bristled down upon it, and banished all colour, to substitute in its place a clear oily polish.
000010|Nothing moved in sky, land, or sea, except a frill of milkwhite foam along the nearer angles of the shore, shreds of which licked the contiguous stones like tongues.
000011|He descended and came to a small basin of sea enclosed by the cliffs.
000012|Troy's nature freshened within him;
000013|he thought he would rest and bathe here before going farther.
000014|He undressed and plunged in.
000015|Inside the cove the water was uninteresting to a swimmer, being smooth as a pond, and to get a little of the ocean swell, Troy presently swam between the two projecting spurs of rock which formed the pillars of Hercules to this miniature Mediterranean.
000016|Unfortunately for Troy a current unknown to him existed outside, which, un- important to craft of any burden, was awkward for a swimmer who might be taken in it unawares.
000017|Troy found himself carried to the left and then round in a swoop out to sea.
000018|He now recollected the place and its sinister character.
000019|Many bathers had there prayed for a dry death from time to time, and, like Gonzalo also, had been unanswered;
000020|and Troy began to deem it possible that he might be added to their number.
000021|Not a boat of any kind was at present within sight, but far in the distance Budmouth lay upon the sea, as it were quietly regarding his efforts, and beside the town the harbour showed its position by a dim meshwork of ropes and spars.
000022|After wellnigh exhausting himself in attempts to get back to the mouth of the cove, in his weakness swimming several inches deeper than was his wont, keeping up his breathing entirely by his nostrils, turning upon his back a dozen times over, swimming en papillon and so on, Troy resolved as a last resource to tread water at a slight incline, and so endeavour to reach the shore at any point, merely giving himself a gentle impetus inwards whilst carried on in the general direc- tion of the tide.
000023|This, necessarily a slow process, he found to be not altogether so difficult, and though there was no choice of a landing-place -- the objects on shore passing by him in a sad and slow procession -- he per- ceptibly approached the extremity of a spit of land yet further to the right, now well defined against the sunny portion of the horizon.
000024|While the swimmer's eye's were fixed upon the spit as his only means of salvation on this side of the Unknown, a moving object broke the outline of the extremity, and immediately a ship's boat appeared manned with several sailor lads, her bows towards the sea.
000025|All Troy's vigour spasmodically revived to prolong the struggle yet a little further.
000026|Swimming with his right arm, he held up his left to hail them, splashing upon the waves, and shouting with all his might.
000027|From the position of the setting sun his white form was distinctly visible upon the now deep-hued bosom of the sea to the east of the boat, and the men saw him at once.
000028|Backing their oars and putting the boat about, they pulled towards him with a will, and in five or six minutes from the time of his first halloo, two of the sailors hauled him in over the stern.
000029|They formed part of a brig's crew, and had come ashore for sand.
000030|Lending him what little clothing they could spare among them as a slight protection against late they made again towards the roadstead where their And now night drooped slowly upon the wide watery levels in front;
000031|and at no great distance from them, where the shoreline curved round, and formed a long riband of shade upon the horizon, a series of points of yellow light began to start into existence, denoting the spot to be the site of Budmouth, where the lamps were being lighted along the parade.
