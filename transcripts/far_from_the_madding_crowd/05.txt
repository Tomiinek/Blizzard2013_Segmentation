000001|the news which one day reached Gabriel, that Bathsheba Everdene had left the neighbourhood, had an influence upon him which might have surprised any who never suspected that the more emphatic the renunciation the less absolute its character.
000002|It may have been observed that there is no regula path for getting out of love as there is for getting in.
000003|Some people look upon marriage as a short cut that way, but it has been known to fail.
000004|Separation, which was the means that chance offered to Gabriel Oak by Bathsheba's disappearance though effectual with people of certain humours is apt to idealise the removed object with others -- notably those whose affection, placid and regular as it may be flows deep and long.
000005|Oak belonged to the even-tempered order of humanity, and felt the secret fusion of himself in Bathsheba to be burning with a finer flame now that she was gone -- that was all.
000006|His incipient friendship with her aunt-had been nipped by the failure of his suit, and all that Oak learnt of Bathsheba's movements was done indirectly.
000007|It appeared that she had gone to a place called Weatherbury, more than twenty miles off, but in what capacity -- whether as a visitor, or permanently, he could not discover.
000008|Gabriel had two dogs.
000009|George, the elder, exhibited an ebony-tipped nose, surrounded by a narrow margin of pink flesh, and a coat marked in random splotches approximating in colour to white and slaty grey;
000010|but the grey, after years of sun and rain, had been scorched and washed out of the more prominent locks, leaving them of a reddish-brown, as if the blue component of the grey had faded, like the indigo from the same kind of colour in Turner's pictures.
000011|In substance it had originally been hair, but long contact with sheep seemed to be turning it by degrees into wool of a poor quality and staple.
000012|This dog had originally belonged to a shepherd of inferior morals and dreadful temper, and the result was that George knew the exact degrees of condemnation signified by cursing and swearing of all descriptions better than the wickedest old man in the neighbourhood.
000013|Long experience had so precisely taught the animal the difference between such exclamations as "Come in!" and "D -- -- ye, come in!" that he knew to a hair's breadth the rate of trotting back from the ewes' tails that each call involved, if a staggerer with the sheep crook was to be escaped.
000014|Though old, he was clever and trustworthy still.
000015|The young dog, George's son, might possibly have been the image of his mother, for there was not much resemblance between him and George.
000016|He was learning the sheep-keeping business, so as to follow on at the flock when the other should die, but had got no further than the rudiments as yet -- still finding an insuperable difficulty in distinguishing between doing a thing well enough and doing it too well.
000017|So earnest and yet so wrong-headed was this young dog, he had no, name in particular, and answered with perfect readiness to any pleasant interjection, that if sent behind the flock to help them on, he did it so thoroughly that he would have chased them across the whole county with the greatest pleasure if not called off or reminded when to step by the example of old George.
000018|Thus much for the dogs.
000019|On the further side of Norcombe Hill was a chalk-pit, from which chalk had been drawn for generations, and spread over adjacent farms.
000020|Two hedges converged upon it in the form of a V, but without quite meeting.
000021|The narrow opening left, which was immediately over the brow of the pit, was protected by a rough railing.
000022|One night, when Farmer Oak had returned to, his house, believing there would be no further necessity for his attendance on the down, he called as usual to the dogs, previously to shutting them up in the outhouse till next morning.
000023|Only one responded -- old George;
000024|the other-could not be found, either in the house, lane, or garden.
000025|- Gabriel then remembered that he had left the two dogs on the hill eating a dead lamb (a kind of meat he usually kept from them, except when other food-ran finished his meal, he went indoors to the luxury of a bed, which latterly he had only enjoyed on Sundays.
000026|It was a still, moist night.
000027|Just before dawn he was assisted in waking by the abnormal reverberation of familiar music.
000028|To the shepherd, the note of the sheep chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by ceasing ever distant, that all is well in the fold.
000029|In the solemn This exceptional ringing may be caused in two ways -- by the rapid feeding of the sheep bearing the bell, as when the flock breaks into new pasture, which gives it an intermittent rapidity, or by the sheep starting off in a run, when the sound has a regular palpitation.
000030|The experienced ear of Oak knew the sound he now heard to be caused by the running of the flock with great velocity.
000031|He jumped out of bed, dressed, tore down the lane through a foggy dawn, and ascended the hill.
000032|The forward ewes were kept apart from those among which the fall of lambs would be later, there being two hundred of the latter class in Gabriel's flock.
000033|These two hundred seemed to have absolutely vanished from the hill.
000034|There were the fifty with their lambs, enclosed at the other end as he had left them, but the rest, forming the bulk of the flock, were nowhere.
000035|Gabriel called at the top of his voice the shepherd's call.
000036|"Ovey, ovey, ovey!"
000037|Not a single bleat.
000038|He went to the hedge -- a gap had been broken through it, and in the gap were the footprints of the sheep.
000039|Rather surprised to find them break fence at this season, yet putting it down instantly to their great fondness for ivy in winter-time, of which a great deal grew in the plantation, he followed through the hedge.
000040|They were not in the plantation.
000041|He called again: the valleys and farthest hills resounded as when the sailors invoked the lost Hylas on the Mysian shore;
000042|but no sheep.
000043|He passed through the trees and along the ridge of the hill.
000044|On the extreme summit, where the ends of the two converging hedges of which we have spoken were stopped short by meeting the brow of the chalk-pit, he saw the younger dog standing against the sky -- dark and motionless as Napoleon at saint Helena.
000045|A horrible conviction darted through Oak.
000046|With a sensation of bodily faintness he advanced: at one point the rails were broken through, and there he saw the footprints of his ewes.
000047|The dog came up, licked his hand, and made signs implying that he expected some great reward for signal services rendered.
000048|Oak looked over the precipice.
000049|The ewes lay dead and dying at its foot -- a heap of two hundred mangled carcasses, representing in their condition just now at least two hundred more.
000050|Oak was an intensely humane man: indeed, his humanity often tore in pieces any politic intentions of his which bordered on strategy, and carried him on as by gravitation.
000051|A shadow in his life had always been that his flock ended in mutton -- that a day came and found every shepherd an arrant traitor to his defenseless sheep.
000052|His first feeling now was one of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn lambs.
000053|It was a second to remember another phase of the matter.
000054|The sheep were not insured.
000055|All the savings of a frugal life had been dispersed at a blow;
000056|his hopes of being an independent farmer were laid low -- possibly for ever.
000057|Gabriel's energies, patience, and industry had been so severely taxed during the years of his life between eighteen and eight-and-twenty, to reach his present stage of progress that no more seemed to be left in him.
000058|He hands.
000059|Stupors, however, do not last for ever, and Farmer Oak recovered from his.
000060|It was as remarkable as it was characteristic that the one sentence he uttered was in thankfulness:
000061|Thank God I am not married: what would she have done in the poverty now coming upon me!
000062|Oak raised his head, and wondering what he could do listlessly surveyed the scene.
000063|By the outer margin of the Pit was an oval pond, and over it hung the attenuated skeleton of a chrome-yellow moon which had only a few days to last -- the morning star dogging her on the left hand.
000064|The pool glittered like a dead man's eye, and as the world awoke a breeze blew, shaking and elongating the reflection of the moon without breaking it, and turning the image of the star to a phosphoric streak upon the water.
000065|All this Oak saw and remembered.
000066|As far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor young dog, still under the impression that since he was kept for running after sheep, the more he ran after them the better, had at the end of his meal off the dead lamb, which may have given him additional energy and spirits, collected all the ewes into a corner, driven the timid creatures through the hedge, across the upper field, and by main force of worrying had given them momentum enough to break down a portion of the rotten railing, and so hurled them over the edge.
000067|George's son had done his work so thoroughly that he was considered too good a workman to live, and was, in fact, taken and tragically shot at twelve o'clock that same day -- another instance of the untoward fate which so often attends dogs and other philosophers who follow out a train of reasoning to its logical conclusion, and attempt perfectly consistent conduct in a world made up so largely of compromise.
