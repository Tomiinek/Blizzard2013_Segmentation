000001|it was nearly midnight on the eve of saint Thomas's, the shortest day in the year.
000002|A desolating wind wandered from the north over the hill whereon Oak had watched the yellow waggon and its occupant in the sunshine of a few days earlier.
000003|Norcombe Hill -- not far from lonely Toller-Down -- was one of the spots which suggest to a passer-by that he is in the presence of a shape approaching the indestructible as nearly as any to be found on earth.
000004|It was a featureless convexity of chalk and soil -- an ordinary specimen of those smoothly-outlined protuberances of the globe which may remain undisturbed on some great day of confusion, when far grander heights and dizzy granite precipices topple down.
000005|The hill was covered on its northern side by an ancient and decaying plantation of beeches, whose upper verge formed a line over the crest, fringing its arched curve against the sky, like a mane.
000006|To-night these trees sheltered the southern slope from the keenest blasts, which smote the wood and floundered through it with a sound as of grumbling, or gushed over its crowning boughs in a weakened moan.
000007|The dry leaves in the ditch simmered and boiled in the same breezes, a tongue of air occasionally ferreting out a few, and sending them spinning across the grass.
000008|A group or two of the latest in date amongst the dead multitude had remained till this very mid-winter time on the twigs which bore them and in falling rattled against the trunks with smart taps: Between this half-wooded, half naked hill, and the vague still horizon that its summit indistinctly commanded, was a mysterious sheet of fathomless shade -- the sounds from which suggested that what it concealed bore some reduced resemblance to features here.
000009|The thin grasses, more or less coating the hill, were touched by the wind in breezes of differing powers, and almost of differing natures -- one rubbing the blades heavily, another raking them piercingly, another brushing them like a soft broom.
000010|The instinctive act of humankind was to stand and listen, and learn how the trees to each other in the regular antiphonies of a cathedral choir;
000011|how hedges and other shapes to leeward them caught the note, lowering it to the tenderest sob;
000012|and how the hurrying gust then plunged into the south, to be heard no more.
000013|The sky was clear -- remarkably clear -- and the twinkling of all the stars seemed to be but throbs of one body, timed by a common pulse.
000014|The North Star was directly in the wind's eye, and since evening the Bear had swung round it outwardly to the east, till he was now at a right angle with the meridian.
000015|A difference of colour in the stars -- oftener read of than seen in England-was really perceptible here.
000016|The sovereign brilliancy of Sirius pierced the eye with a steely glitter, the star called Capella was yellow, Aldebaran and Betelgueux shone with a fiery red.
000017|To persons standing alone on a hill during a clear midnight such as this, the roll of the world eastward is almost a palpable movement.
000018|The sensation may be caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past earthly objects, which is perceptible in a few minutes of stillness, or by the better outlook upon space that a hill affords, or by the wind, or by the solitude;
000019|but whatever be its origin, the impression of riding along is vivid and abiding.
000020|The poetry of motion is a phrase much in use, and to enjoy the epic form of that gratification it is necessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the night, and, having first expanded with a sense of difference from the mass of civilised mankind, who are dreamwrapt and disregardful of all such proceedings at this time, long and quietly watch your stately progress through the stars.
000021|After such a nocturnal reconnoitre it is hard to get back to earth, and to believe that the consciousness of such majestic speeding is derived from a tiny human frame.
000022|Suddenly an unexpected series of sounds began to be heard in this place up against the sky.
000023|They had a clearness which was to be found nowhere in the wind, and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in nature.
000024|They were the notes of Farmer Oak's flute.
000025|The tune was not floating unhindered into the open air: it seemed muffled in some way, and was altogether too curtailed in power to spread high or wide.
000026|It came from the direction of a small dark object under the plantation hedge -- a shepherd's hut -- now presenting an outline to which an uninitiated person might have been puzzled to attach either meaning or use.
000027|The image as a whole was that of a small Noah's Ark on a small Ararat, allowing the traditionary outlines and general form of the Ark which are followed by toymakers -- and by these means are established in men's imaginations among their firmest, because earliest impressions -- to pass as an approximate pattern.
000028|The hut stood on little wheels, which raised its floor about a foot from the ground.
000029|Such shepherds' huts are dragged into the fields when the lambing season comes on, to shelter the shepherd in hisenforced nightly attendance.
000030|It was only latterly that people had begun to call Gabriel "Farmer" Oak.
000031|During the twelvemonth preceding this time he had been enabled by sustained efforts of industry and chronic good spirits to lease the small sheep farm of which Norcombe Hill was a portion, and stock it with two hundred sheep.
000032|Previously he had been a bailiff for a short time, and earlier still a shepherd only, having from his childhood assisted his father in tending the flocks of large proprietors, till old Gabriel sank to rest.
000033|This venture, unaided and alone, into the paths of farming as master and not as man, with an advance of sheep not yet paid for, was a critical juncture with Gabriel Oak, and he recognised his position clearly.
000034|The first movement in his new progress was the lambing of his ewes, and sheep having been his speciality from his "youth, he wisely refrained from deputing -- the task of tending them at this season to a hireling or a novice."
000035|The wind continued to beat-about the corners of the hut, but the flute-playing ceased.
000036|A rectangular space of light appeared in the side of the hut, and in the opening the outline of Farmer Oak's figure.
000037|He carried a lantern in his hand, and closing the door behind him, came forward and busied himself about this nook of the field for nearly twenty minutes, the lantern light appearing and disappearing here and there, and brightening him or darkening him as he stood before or behind it.
000038|Oak's motions, though they had a quiet-energy, were slow, and their deliberateness accorded well with his occupation.
000039|"Fitness being the basis of beauty, nobody could-have denied that his steady swings and turns" in and about the flock had elements of grace, Yet, although if occasion demanded he could do or think a thing with as mercurial a dash as can the men of towns who are more to the manner born, his special power, morally, physically, and mentally, was static, owing little or nothing to momentum as a rule.
000040|A close examination of the ground hereabout, even by the wan starlight only, revealed how a portion of what would have been casually called a wild slope had been appropriated by Farmer Oak for his great purpose this winter.
000041|Detached hurdles thatched with straw were stuck into the ground at various scattered points, amid and under which the whitish forms of his meek ewes moved and rustled.
000042|The ring of the sheep-bell, which had been silent during his absence, recommenced, in tones that had more mellowness than clearness, owing to an increasing growth of surrounding wool.
000043|This continued till Oak withdrew again from the flock.
000044|He -- returned to the hut, bringing in his arms a new-born lamb, consisting of four legs large enough for a fullgrown sheep, united by a seemingly inconsiderable membrane about half the substance of the legs collectively, which constituted the animal's entire body just at present.
000045|The little speck of life he placed on a wisp of hay before the small stove, where a can of milk was simmering.
000046|Oak extinguished the lantern by blowing into it and then pinching the snuff, the cot being lighted by a candle suspended by a twisted wire.
000047|A rather hard couch, formed of a few corn sacks thrown carelessly down, covered half the floor of this little habitation, and here the young man stretched himself along, loosened his woollen cravat, and closed his eyes.
000048|In about the time a person unaccustomed to bodily labour would have decided upon which side to lie, Farmer Oak was asleep.
000049|The inside of the hut, as it now presented itself, was cosy and alluring, and the scarlet handful of fire in addition to the candle, reflecting its own genial colour upon whatever it could reach, flung associations of enjoyment even over utensils and tools.
000050|In the corner stood the sheep-crook, and along a shelf at one side were ranged bottles and canisters of the simple preparations pertaining to bovine surgery and physic;
000051|spirits of wine, turpentine, tar, magnesia, ginger, and castor-oil being the chief.
000052|On a triangular shelf across the corner stood bread, bacon, cheese, and a cup for ale or cider, which was supplied from a flagon beneath.
000053|Beside the provisions lay the flute whose notes had lately been called forth by the lonely watcher to beguile a tedious hour.
000054|The house was ventilated by two round holes, like the lights of a ship's cabin, with wood slides- The lamb, revived by the warmth began to bleat instant meaning, as expected sounds will.
000055|Passing from the profoundest sleep to the most alert wakefulness with the same ease that had accompanied the reverse operation, he looked at his watch, found that the hourhand had shifted again, put on his hat, took the lamb in his arms, and carried it into the darkness.
000056|After placing the little creature with its mother, he stood and carefully examined the sky, to ascertain the time of night from the altitudes of the stars.
000057|The Dog-star and Aldebaran, pointing to the restless Pleiades, were half-way up the Southern sky, and between them hung Orion, which gorgeous constellation never burnt more vividly than now, as it soared forth above the rim of the landscape.
000058|Castor and Pollux will the north-west;
000059|far away through the plantation Vega and Cassiopeia's chair stood daintily poised on the uppermost boughs.
000060|"One o'clock." said Gabriel.
000061|Being a man not without a frequent consciousness that there was some charm in this life he led, he stood still after looking at the sky as a useful instrument, and regarded it in an appreciative spirit, as a work of art superlatively beautiful.
000062|For a moment he seemed impressed with the speaking loneliness of the scene, or rather with the complete abstraction from all its compass of the sights and sounds of man.
000063|Human shapes,interferences, troubles, and joys were all as if they were not, and there seemed to be on the shaded hemisphere of the globe no sentient being save himself;
000064|he could fancy them all gone round to the sunny side.
000065|Occupied this, with eyes stretched afar, Oak gradually perceived that what he had previously taken to be a star low down behind the outskirts of the plantation was in reality no such thing.
000066|It was an artificial light, almost close at hand.
000067|To find themselves utterly alone at night where company is desirable and expected makes some people fearful;
000068|but a case more trying by far to the nerves is to discover some mysterious companionship when intuition, sensation, memory, analogy, testimony, probability, induction -- every kind of evidence in the logician's list -- have united to persuade consciousness that it is quite in isolation.
000069|Farmer Oak went towards the plantation and pushed through its lower boughs to the windy side.
000070|A dim mass under the slope reminded him that a shed occupied a place here, the site being a cutting into the slope of the hill, so that at its back part the roof was almost level with the ground.
000071|In front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered with tar as a preservative.
000072|Through crevices in the roof and side spread streaks and spots of light, a combination of which made the radiance that had attracted him.
000073|Oak stepped up behind, where,leaning down upon the roof and putting his eye close to a hole, he could see into the interior clearly.
000074|The place contained two women and two cows.
000075|By the side of the latter a steaming bran-mash stood in a bucket.
000076|One of the women was past middle age.
000077|Her companion was apparently young and graceful;
000078|he could form no decided opinion upon her looks, her position being almost beneath his eye, so that he saw her in a bird's-eye view, as Milton's Satan first saw Paradise.
000079|She wore no bonnet or het, but had enveloped herself in a large cloak, which was carelessly flung over her head as a covering.
000080|"There, now we'll go home," said the elder of the two, resting her knuckles upon her hips, and looking at their goings-on as a whole.
000081|I do hope Daisy will fetch round again now.
000082|I have never been more frightened in my life, but I don't mind breaking my rest if she recovers.
000083|The young woman, whose eyelids were apparently inclined to fall together on the smallest provocation of silence,yawned in sympathy.
000084|"I wish we were rich enough to pay a man to do these things," she said.
000085|"As we are not, we must do them ourselves," said the other;
000086|for you must help me if you stay.
000087|"Well, my hat is gone, however," continued the younger.
000088|It went over the hedge, I think.
000089|The idea of such a slight wind catching it.
000090|The cow standing erect was of the Devon breed, and was encased in a tight warm hide of rich Indian red, as absolutely uniform from eyes to tail as if the animal had been dipped in a dye of that colour, her long back being mathematically level.
000091|The other was spotted,grey and white.
000092|Beside her Oak now noticed a little calf about a day old, looking idiotically at the two women, which showed that it had not long been accustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight, and often turning to the lantern, which it apparently mistook for the moon.
000093|inherited instinct having as yet had little time for correction by experience.
000094|Between the sheep and the cows Lucina had been busy on Norcombe hill lately.
000095|"I think we had better send for some oatmeal," said the "Yes, aunt;"
000096|and I'll ride over for it as soon as it is light.
000097|But there's no side-saddle.
000098|I can ride on the other: trust me.
000099|Oak, upon hearing these remarks, became more curious to observe her features, but this prospect being denied him by the hooding effect of the cloak, and by his aerial position, he felt himself drawing upon his fancy for their details.
000100|In making even horizontal and clear inspections we colour and mould according to the warts within us whatever our eyes bring in.
000101|Had Gabriel been able from the first to get a distinct view of her countenance, his estimate of it as very handsome or slightly so would have been as his soul required a divinity at the moment or was ready supplied with one.
000102|Having for some time known the want of a satisfactory form to fill an increasing void within him, his position moreover affording the widest scope for his fancy, he painted her a beauty.
000103|By one of those whimsical coincidences in which Nature, like a busy mother, seems to spare a moment from her unremitting labours to turn and make her children smile, the girl now dropped the cloak, and forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket.
000104|Oak knew her instantly as the heroine of the yellow waggon, myrtles, and looking-glass: prosily, as the woman who owed him twopence.
000105|They placed the calf beside its mother again, took up the lantern, and went out, the light sinking down the hill till it was no more than a nebula.
