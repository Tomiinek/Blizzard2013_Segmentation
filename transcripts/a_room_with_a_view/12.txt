000001|It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.
000002|All that was gracious triumphed.
000003|As the motorcars passed through Summer Street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines.
000004|mister Beebe, at leisure for life's amenities, leant over his Rectory gate.
000005|Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.
000006|Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.
000007|M'm.
000008|They might amuse you.
000009|Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just moved in.
000010|"I suggested we should hinder them," said mister Beebe.
000011|They are worth it.
000012|Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to Cissie Villa.
000013|"Hullo!" he cried, shouting in at the open door, through which much squalor was visible.
000014|A grave voice replied, "Hullo!"
000015|I've brought someone to see you.
000016|I'll be down in a minute.
000017|The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs.
000018|mister Beebe edged round it with difficulty.
000019|The sitting-room itself was blocked with books.
000020|"Are these people great readers?" Freddy whispered.
000021|Are they that sort?
000022|I fancy they know how to read -- a rare accomplishment.
000023|What have they got?
000024|Byron.
000025|Exactly.
000026|A Shropshire Lad.
000027|Never heard of it.
000028|The Way of All Flesh.
000029|Never heard of it.
000030|Gibbon.
000031|Hullo! dear George reads German.
000032|Um -- um -- Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on.
000033|Well, I suppose your generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.
000034|"mister Beebe, look at that," said Freddy in awestruck tones.
000035|On the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription: "Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes."
000036|I know.
000037|Isn't it jolly?
000038|I like that.
000039|I'm certain that's the old man's doing.
000040|How very odd of him!
000041|Surely you agree?
000042|But Freddy was his mother's son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture.
000043|"Pictures!" the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.
000044|Giotto -- they got that at Florence, I'll be bound.
000045|The same as Lucy's got.
000046|Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?
000047|She came back yesterday.
000048|I suppose she had a good time?
000049|"Yes, very," said Freddy, taking up a book.
000050|She and Cecil are thicker than ever.
000051|That's good hearing.
000052|I wish I wasn't such a fool, mister Beebe.
000053|mister Beebe ignored the remark.
000054|Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it'll be very different now, mother thinks.
000055|She will read all kinds of books.
000056|So will you.
000057|Only medical books.
000058|Not books that you can talk about afterwards.
000059|Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.
000060|There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed.
000061|Cecil says "What on earth are those people doing upstairs?"
000062|Emerson -- we think we'll come another time.
000063|George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.
000064|Let me introduce mister Honeychurch, a neighbour.
000065|Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth.
000066|Perhaps he was shy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George's face wanted washing.
000067|At all events he greeted him with, "How d'ye do?"
000068|Come and have a bathe.
000069|"Oh, all right," said George, impassive.
000070|mister Beebe was highly entertained.
000071|'How d'ye do? how d'ye do?
000072|"Come and have a bathe," he chuckled.
000073|That's the best conversational opening I've ever heard.
000074|But I'm afraid it will only act between men.
000075|Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with 'How do you do?
000076|Come and have a bathe'?
000077|And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal.
000078|"I tell you that they shall be," said mister Emerson, who had been slowly descending the stairs.
000079|Good afternoon, mister Beebe.
000080|I tell you they shall be comrades, and George thinks the same.
000081|"We are to raise ladies to our level?" the clergyman inquired.
000082|"The Garden of Eden," pursued mister Emerson, still descending, "which you place in the past, is really yet to come."
000083|We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies.
000084|mister Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.
000085|In this -- not in other things -- we men are ahead.
000086|We despise the body less than women do.
000087|But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden.
000088|"I say, what about this bathe?" murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him.
000089|I believed in a return to Nature once.
000090|But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her?
000091|To-day, I believe that we must discover Nature.
000092|After many conquests we shall attain simplicity.
000093|It is our heritage.
000094|Let me introduce mister Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at Florence.
000095|How do you do?
000096|Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George for a bathe.
000097|Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.
000098|Marriage is a duty.
000099|I am sure that she will be happy, for we know mister Vyse, too.
000100|He has been most kind.
000101|He met us by chance in the National Gallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house.
000102|Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway.
000103|I have met so few Liberal landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude.
000104|Ah, this wind!
000105|You do well to bathe.
000106|Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!
000107|"Not a bit!" mumbled Freddy.
000108|I must -- that is to say, I have to -- have the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.
000109|call, my lad?
000110|Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle?
000111|Call on your grandmother!
000112|Listen to the wind among the pines!
000113|Yours is a glorious country.
000114|mister Beebe came to the rescue.
000115|mister Emerson, he will call, I shall call;
000116|you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed.
000117|I trust that you have realized about the ten days' interval.
000118|It does not count that I helped you with the stair-eyes yesterday.
000119|It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon.
000120|Yes, go and bathe, George.
000121|Why do you dawdle talking?
000122|Bring them back to tea.
000123|Bring back some milk, cakes, honey.
000124|The change will do you good.
000125|George has been working very hard at his office.
000126|I can't believe he's well.
000127|George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture.
000128|"Do you really want this bathe?" Freddy asked him.
000129|It is only a pond, don't you know.
000130|I dare say you are used to something better.
000131|Yes -- I have said 'Yes' already.
000132|mister Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of the house and into the pine-woods.
000133|How glorious it was!
000134|For a little time the voice of old mister Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy.
000135|It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees.
000136|mister Beebe, who could be silent, but who could not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a word.
000137|He spoke of Florence.
000138|George attended gravely, assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.
000139|And what a coincidence that you should meet mister Vyse!
000140|Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?
000141|I did not.
000142|Miss Lavish told me.
000143|When I was a young man, I always meant to write a 'History of Coincidence.'
000144|No enthusiasm.
000145|Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we suppose.
000146|For example, it isn't purely coincidentally that you are here now, when one comes to reflect.
000147|To his relief, George began to talk.
000148|It is.
000149|I have reflected.
000150|It is Fate.
000151|Everything is Fate.
000152|We are flung together by Fate, drawn apart by Fate -- flung together, drawn apart.
000153|The twelve winds blow us -- we settle nothing
000154|"You have not reflected at all," rapped the clergyman.
000155|Let me give you a useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate.
000156|Don't say, 'I didn't do this,' for you did it, ten to one.
000157|Now I'll cross-question you.
000158|Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?
000159|Italy.
000160|And where did you meet mister Vyse, who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch?
000161|National Gallery.
000162|Looking at Italian art.
000163|There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate.
000164|You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our friends.
000165|This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.
000166|"It is Fate that I am here," persisted George.
000167|But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.
000168|mister Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject.
000169|But he was infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.
000170|And so for this and for other reasons my 'History of Coincidence' is still to write.
000171|Silence.
000172|Wishing to round off the episode, he added;
000173|We are all so glad that you have come.
000174|Silence.
000175|"Here we are!" called Freddy.
000176|"Oh, good!" exclaimed mister Beebe, mopping his brow.
000177|In there's the pond.
000178|"I wish it was bigger," he added apologetically.
000179|They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles.
000180|There lay the pond, set in its little alp of green -- only a pond, but large enough to contain the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky.
000181|On account of the rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.
000182|"It's distinctly successful, as ponds go," said mister Beebe.
000183|No apologies are necessary for the pond.
000184|George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his boots.
000185|Aren't those masses of willow-herb splendid?
000186|I love willow-herb in seed.
000187|What's the name of this aromatic plant?
000188|No one knew, or seemed to care.
000189|These abrupt changes of vegetation -- this little spongeous tract of water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle -- heather, bracken, hurts, pines.
000190|Very charming, very charming.
000191|"mister Beebe, aren't you bathing?" called Freddy, as he stripped himself.
000192|mister Beebe thought he was not.
000193|"Water's wonderful!" cried Freddy, prancing in.
000194|"Water's water," murmured George.
000195|Wetting his hair first -- a sure sign of apathy -- he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds.
000196|It was necessary to use his muscles.
000197|It was necessary to keep clean.
000198|mister Beebe watched them, and watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads.
000199|"Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo," went Freddy, swimming for two strokes in either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.
000200|"Is it worth it?" asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded margin.
000201|The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly.
000202|Hee-poof -- I've swallowed a pollywog, mister Beebe, water's wonderful, water's simply ripping.
000203|"Water's not so bad," said George, reappearing from his plunge, and sputtering at the sun.
000204|Water's wonderful.
000205|mister Beebe, do.
000206|Apooshoo, kouf.
000207|mister Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible, looked around him.
000208|He could detect no parishioners except the pine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other against the blue.
000209|How glorious it was!
000210|The world of motor-cars and rural Deans receded inimitably.
000211|Water, sky, evergreens, a wind -- these things not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man?
000212|"I may as well wash too";
000213|and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.
000214|It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad.
000215|The three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in Gotterdammerung.
000216|But either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit -- for some reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and Botany and Fate.
000217|They began to play.
000218|mister Beebe and Freddy splashed each other.
000219|A little deferentially, they splashed George.
000220|He was quiet: they feared they had offended him.
000221|Then all the forces of youth burst out.
000222|He smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.
000223|"Race you round it, then," cried Freddy, and they raced in the sunshine, and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to bathe a second time.
000224|Then mister Beebe consented to run -- a memorable sight.
000225|They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get clean.
000226|And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward, proclaiming:
000227|No. We are what matters.
000228|Without us shall no enterprise begin.
000229|To us shall all flesh turn in the end.
000230|A try!
000231|"A try!" yelled Freddy, snatching up George's bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goal-post.
000232|"Socker rules," George retorted, scattering Freddy's bundle with a kick.
000233|Goal!
000234|Goal!
000235|Pass!
000236|"Take care my watch!" cried mister Beebe.
000237|Clothes flew in all directions.
000238|Take care my hat!
000239|No, that's enough, Freddy.
000240|Dress now.
000241|No, I say!
000242|But the two young men were delirious.
000243|Away they twinkled into the trees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a wide-awake hat on his dripping hair.
000244|"That'll do!" shouted mister Beebe, remembering that after all he was in his own parish.
000245|Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a Rural Dean.
000246|Hi!
000247|Steady on!
000248|I see people coming you fellows!
000249|Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.
000250|Hi! hi! ladies!
000251|Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined.
000252|Still, they did not hear mister Beebe's last warning or they would have avoided misess Honeychurch, Cecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old misess Butterworth.
000253|Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some bracken.
000254|George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the path to the pond, still clad in mister Beebe's hat.
000255|"Gracious alive!" cried misess Honeychurch.
000256|Whoever were those unfortunate people?
000257|Oh, dears, look away!
000258|And poor mister Beebe, too!
000259|Whatever has happened?
000260|"Come this way immediately," commanded Cecil, who always felt that he must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though he knew not against what.
000261|He led them now towards the bracken where Freddy sat concealed.
000262|Oh, poor mister Beebe!
000263|Was that his waistcoat we left in the path?
000264|Cecil, mister Beebe's waistcoat
000265|"No business of ours," said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol and evidently 'minded.'
000266|I fancy mister Beebe jumped back into the pond.
000267|This way, please, misess Honeychurch, this way.
000268|They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.
000269|"Well, I can't help it," said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds.
000270|I can't be trodden on, can I?
000271|Good gracious me, dear;
000272|so it's you!
000273|What miserable management!
000274|Why not have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?
000275|Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow's got to dry, and if another fellow
000276|Dear, no doubt you're right as usual, but you are in no position to argue.
000277|"Come, Lucy." They turned.
000278|Oh, look -- don't look!
000279|Oh, poor mister Beebe!
000280|How unfortunate again
000281|For mister Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float;
000282|while George, the world-weary George, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.
000283|"And me, I've swallowed one," answered he of the bracken.
000284|I've swallowed a pollywog.
000285|It wriggleth in my tummy.
000286|I shall die -- Emerson you beast, you've got on my bags.
000287|"Hush, dears," said misess Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain shocked.
000288|And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first.
000289|All these colds come of not drying thoroughly.
000290|"Mother, do come away," said Lucy.
000291|Oh for goodness' sake, do come.
000292|"Hullo!" cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.
000293|He regarded himself as dressed.
000294|Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and personable against the shadowy woods, he called:
000295|Hullo, Miss Honeychurch!
000296|Hullo!
000297|Bow, Lucy;
000298|better bow.
000299|Whoever is it?
000300|I shall bow.
000301|Miss Honeychurch bowed.
000302|That evening and all that night the water ran away.
000303|On the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory.
