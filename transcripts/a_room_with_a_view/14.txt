000001|Of course Miss Bartlett accepted.
000002|And, equally of course, she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior spare room -- something with no view, anything.
000003|Her love to Lucy.
000004|And, equally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday week.
000005|Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only faced the situation that encompassed her.
000006|She never gazed inwards.
000007|If at times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to nerves.
000008|When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset her nerves.
000009|Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might upset her nerves.
000010|She was nervous at night.
000011|When she talked to George -- they met again almost immediately at the Rectory -- his voice moved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him.
000012|How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him!
000013|Of course, the wish was due to nerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us.
000014|Once she had suffered from "things that came out of nothing and meant she didn't know what."
000015|Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed.
000016|It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, "She loves young Emerson."
000017|A reader in Lucy's place would not find it obvious.
000018|Life is easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome "nerves" or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire.
000019|She loved Cecil;
000020|George made her nervous;
000021|will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed?
000022|But the external situation -- she will face that bravely.
000023|The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough.
000024|Standing between mister Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy, and George had replied.
000025|She was anxious to show that she was not shy, and was glad that he did not seem shy either.
000026|"A nice fellow," said mister Beebe afterwards "He will work off his crudities in time."
000027|I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully.
000028|Lucy said, "He seems in better spirits."
000029|He laughs more.
000030|"Yes," replied the clergyman.
000031|He is waking up.
000032|That was all.
000033|But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and she entertained an image that had physical beauty.
000034|In spite of the clearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival.
000035|She was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither misess Honeychurch drove to meet her.
000036|She arrived at the London and Brighton station, and had to hire a cab up.
000037|No one was at home except Freddy and his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour.
000038|Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o'clock, and these, with little Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea.
000039|"I shall never forgive myself," said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
000040|I have upset everything.
000041|Bursting in on young people!
000042|But I insist on paying for my cab up.
000043|Grant that, at any rate.
000044|"Our visitors never do such dreadful things," said Lucy, while her brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: "Just what I've been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour."
000045|"I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor," said Miss Bartlett, and looked at her frayed glove.
000046|All right, if you'd really rather.
000047|Five shillings, and I gave a bob to the driver.
000048|Miss Bartlett looked in her purse.
000049|Only sovereigns and pennies.
000050|Could any one give her change?
000051|Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four half-crowns.
000052|Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: "But who am I to give the sovereign to?"
000053|"Let's leave it all till mother comes back," suggested Lucy.
000054|No, dear;
000055|your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me.
000056|We all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt settling of accounts.
000057|Here Freddy's friend, mister Floyd, made the one remark of his that need be quoted: he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett's quid.
000058|A solution seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance, and turned round.
000059|But this did not do, either.
000060|Please -- please -- I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me wretched.
000061|I should practically be robbing the one who lost.
000062|"Freddy owes me fifteen shillings," interposed Cecil.
000063|So it will work out right if you give the pound to me.
000064|"Fifteen shillings," said Miss Bartlett dubiously.
000065|How is that, mister Vyse?
000066|Because, don't you see, Freddy paid your cab.
000067|Give me the pound, and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling.
000068|Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths.
000069|For a moment Cecil was happy.
000070|He was playing at nonsense among his peers.
000071|Then he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles.
000072|In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this stupefying twaddle.
000073|"But I don't see that!" exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction.
000074|I don't see why mister Vyse is to have the quid.
000075|"Because of the fifteen shillings and the five," they said solemnly.
000076|Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.
000077|But I don't see
000078|They tried to stifle her with cake.
000079|No, thank you.
000080|I'm done.
000081|I don't see why -- Freddy, don't poke me.
000082|Miss Honeychurch, your brother's hurting me.
000083|Ow! What about mister Floyd's ten shillings?
000084|Ow! No, I don't see and I never shall see why Miss What's-her-name shouldn't pay that bob for the driver.
000085|"I had forgotten the driver," said Miss Bartlett, reddening.
000086|Thank you, dear, for reminding me.
000087|A shilling was it?
000088|Can any one give me change for half a crown?
000089|"I'll get it," said the young hostess, rising with decision.
000090|Cecil, give me that sovereign.
000091|No, give me up that sovereign.
000092|I'll get Euphemia to change it, and we'll start the whole thing again from the beginning.
000093|"Lucy -- Lucy -- what a nuisance I am!" protested Miss Bartlett, and followed her across the lawn.
000094|Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity.
000095|When they were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly: "Have you told him about him yet?"
000096|"No, I haven't," replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant.
000097|Let me see -- a sovereign's worth of silver.
000098|She escaped into the kitchen.
000099|Miss Bartlett's sudden transitions were too uncanny.
000100|It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken;
000101|as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul.
000102|"No, I haven't told Cecil or any one," she remarked, when she returned.
000103|I promised you I shouldn't.
000104|Here is your money -- all shillings, except two half-crowns.
000105|Would you count it?
000106|You can settle your debt nicely now.
000107|Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of saint John ascending, which had been framed.
000108|"How dreadful!" she murmured, "how more than dreadful, if mister Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source."
000109|"Oh, no, Charlotte," said the girl, entering the battle.
000110|George Emerson is all right, and what other source is there?
000111|Miss Bartlett considered.
000112|For instance, the driver.
000113|I saw him looking through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.
000114|Lucy shuddered a little.
000115|We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren't careful.
000116|How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of Cecil?
000117|We must think of every possibility.
000118|Oh, it's all right.
000119|Or perhaps old mister Emerson knows.
000120|In fact, he is certain to know.
000121|I don't care if he does.
000122|I was grateful to you for your letter, but even if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it.
000123|To contradict it?
000124|No, to laugh at it.
000125|But she knew in her heart that she could not trust him, for he desired her untouched.
000126|Very well, dear, you know best.
000127|Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young.
000128|Ladies are certainly different.
000129|"Now, Charlotte!" She struck at her playfully.
000130|You kind, anxious thing.
000131|What would you have me do?
000132|First you say 'Don't tell';
000133|and then you say, 'Tell'.
000134|Which is it to be?
000135|Quick!
000136|Miss Bartlett sighed "I am no match for you in conversation, dearest."
000137|I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am.
000138|You will never forgive me.
000139|Shall we go out, then.
000140|They will smash all the china if we don't.
000141|For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with a teaspoon.
000142|Dear, one moment -- we may not have this chance for a chat again.
000143|Have you seen the young one yet?
000144|Yes, I have.
000145|What happened?
000146|We met at the Rectory.
000147|What line is he taking up?
000148|No line.
000149|He talked about Italy, like any other person.
000150|It is really all right.
000151|What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it bluntly?
000152|I do wish I could make you see it my way.
000153|He really won't be any nuisance, Charlotte.
000154|Once a cad, always a cad.
000155|That is my poor opinion.
000156|Lucy paused.
000157|Cecil said one day -- and I thought it so profound -- that there are two kinds of cads -- the conscious and the subconscious.
000158|She paused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil's profundity.
000159|Through the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a novel.
000160|It was a new one from Smith's library.
000161|Her mother must have returned from the station.
000162|"Once a cad, always a cad," droned Miss Bartlett.
000163|What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head.
000164|I fell into all those violets, and he was silly and surprised.
000165|I don't think we ought to blame him very much.
000166|It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly.
000167|It really does;
000168|it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn't admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw.
000169|Freddy rather likes him, and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself.
000170|He has improved;
000171|he doesn't always look as if he's going to burst into tears.
000172|He is a clerk in the General Manager's office at one of the big railways -- not a porter!
000173|and runs down to his father for week-ends.
000174|Papa was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired.
000175|There!
000176|Now for the garden.
000177|She took hold of her guest by the arm.
000178|Suppose we don't talk about this silly Italian business any more.
000179|We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.
000180|Lucy thought this rather a good speech.
000181|The reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it.
000182|Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one cannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people.
000183|She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess.
