000001|He was bewildered.
000002|He had nothing to say.
000003|He was not even angry, but stood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion.
000004|She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their bourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men.
000005|Freddy and mister Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably lingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.
000006|"I am very sorry about it," she said;
000007|I have carefully thought things over.
000008|We are too different.
000009|I must ask you to release me, and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl.
000010|It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her voice showed it.
000011|Different -- how -- how
000012|"I haven't had a really good education, for one thing," she continued, still on her knees by the sideboard.
000013|My Italian trip came too late, and I am forgetting all that I learnt there.
000014|I shall never be able to talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.
000015|I don't understand you.
000016|You aren't like yourself.
000017|You're tired, Lucy.
000018|"Tired!" she retorted, kindling at once.
000019|That is exactly like you.
000020|You always think women don't mean what they say.
000021|Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.
000022|What if I do?
000023|It doesn't prevent me from realizing the truth.
000024|I can't marry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.
000025|"You had that bad headache yesterday -- All right" -- for she had exclaimed indignantly: "I see it's much more than headaches."
000026|"But give me a moment's time." He closed his eyes.
000027|You must excuse me if I say stupid things, but my brain has gone to pieces.
000028|Part of it lives three minutes back, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part -- I find it difficult -- I am likely to say the wrong thing.
000029|It struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation increased.
000030|She again desired a struggle, not a discussion.
000031|To bring on the crisis, she said:
000032|There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them.
000033|Things must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.
000034|If you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to you -- when you wouldn't play tennis with Freddy.
000035|"I never do play tennis," said Cecil, painfully bewildered;
000036|I never could play.
000037|I don't understand a word you say.
000038|You can play well enough to make up a four.
000039|I thought it abominably selfish of you.
000040|No, I can't -- well, never mind the tennis.
000041|Why couldn't you -- couldn't you have warned me if you felt anything wrong?
000042|You talked of our wedding at lunch -- at least, you let me talk.
000043|"I knew you wouldn't understand," said Lucy quite crossly.
000044|I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations.
000045|Of course, it isn't the tennis -- that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks.
000046|Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain.
000047|She developed this position.
000048|Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife -- for instance, in London;
000049|and are you fitted to be my husband?
000050|I don't think so.
000051|You don't like Freddy, nor my mother.
000052|There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good mentioning it until -- well, until all things came to a point.
000053|They have to-day.
000054|I see clearly.
000055|I must speak.
000056|That's all.
000057|"I cannot think you were right," said Cecil gently.
000058|I cannot tell why, but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not treating me fairly.
000059|It's all too horrible.
000060|What's the good of a scene?
000061|No good.
000062|But surely I have a right to hear a little more.
000063|He put down his glass and opened the window.
000064|From where she knelt, jangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into it, as if it would tell him that "little more," his long, thoughtful face.
000065|Don't open the window;
000066|and you'd better draw the curtain, too;
000067|"Freddy or any one might be outside." He obeyed.
000068|I really think we had better go to bed, if you don't mind.
000069|I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards.
000070|As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good talking.
000071|But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment more desirable.
000072|He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first time since they were engaged.
000073|From a Leonardo she had become a living woman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even eluded art.
000074|His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of genuine devotion, he cried: "But I love you, and I did think you loved me!"
000075|"I did not," she said.
000076|I thought I did at first.
000077|I am sorry, and ought to have refused you this last time, too.
000078|He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour.
000079|She had counted on his being petty.
000080|It would have made things easier for her.
000081|By a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition.
000082|You don't love me, evidently.
000083|I dare say you are right not to.
000084|But it would hurt a little less if I knew why.
000085|"Because" -- a phrase came to her, and she accepted it -- "you're the sort who can't know any one intimately."
000086|A horrified look came into his eyes.
000087|I don't mean exactly that.
000088|But you will question me, though I beg you not to, and I must say something.
000089|It is that, more or less.
000090|"When we were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you're always protecting me." Her voice swelled.
000091|I won't be protected.
000092|I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right.
000093|To shield me is an insultimate.
000094|Can't I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through you?
000095|A woman's place!
000096|You despise my mother -- I know you do -- because she's conventional and bothers over puddings;
000097|"but, oh goodness!" -- she rose to her feet -- "conventional, Cecil, you're that, for you may understand beautiful things, but you don't know how to use them;"
000098|and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me.
000099|I won't be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more glorious, and you hide them from me.
000100|That's why I break off my engagement.
000101|You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when you came to people
000102|She stopped.
000103|There was a pause.
000104|Then Cecil said with great emotion:
000105|It is true.
000106|"True on the whole," she corrected, full of some vague shame.
000107|True, every word.
000108|It is a revelation.
000109|It is -- I.
000110|Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.
000111|He repeated: "'The sort that can know no one intimately.' It is true."
000112|I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged.
000113|I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother.
000114|You are even greater than I thought.
000115|She withdrew a step.
000116|I'm not going to worry you.
000117|You are far too good to me.
000118|I shall never forget your insight;
000119|and, dear, I only blame you for this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you wouldn't marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve.
000120|I have never known you till this evening.
000121|I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be.
000122|But this evening you are a different person: new thoughts -- even a new voice
000123|"What do you mean by a new voice?" she asked, seized with incontrollable anger.
000124|"I mean that a new person seems speaking through you," said he.
000125|Then she lost her balance.
000126|She cried: "If you think I am in love with someone else, you are very much mistaken."
000127|Of course I don't think that.
000128|You are not that kind, Lucy.
000129|Oh, yes, you do think it.
000130|It's your old idea, the idea that has kept Europe back -- I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men.
000131|If a girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: 'Oh, she had some one else in her mind;
000132|she hopes to get someone else.' It's disgusting, brutal!
000133|As if a girl can't break it off for the sake of freedom.
000134|He answered reverently: "I may have said that in the past."
000135|I shall never say it again.
000136|You have taught me better.
000137|She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again.
000138|Of course, there is no question of 'someone else' in this, no 'jilting' or any such nauseous stupidity.
000139|I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was.
000140|I only meant that there was a force in you that I hadn't known of up till now.
000141|All right, Cecil, that will do.
000142|Don't apologize to me.
000143|It was my mistake.
000144|It is a question between ideals, yours and mine -- pure abstract ideals, and yours are the nobler.
000145|"I was bound up in the old vicious notions, and all the time you were splendid and new." His voice broke.
000146|I must actually thank you for what you have done -- for showing me what I really am.
000147|Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman.
000148|Will you shake hands?
000149|"Of course I will," said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the curtains.
000150|Good-night, Cecil.
000151|Good-bye.
000152|That's all right.
000153|I'm sorry about it.
000154|Thank you very much for your gentleness.
000155|Let me light your candle, shall I?
000156|They went into the hall.
000157|Thank you.
000158|Good-night again.
000159|God bless you, Lucy!
000160|Good-bye, Cecil.
000161|She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings.
000162|On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.
000163|For all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it.
000164|She could never marry.
000165|In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.
000166|Cecil believed in her;
000167|she must some day believe in herself.
000168|She must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for liberty and not for men;
000169|she must forget that George loved her, that George had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release, that George had gone away into -- what was it? -- the darkness.
000170|She put out the lamp.
000171|It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel.
000172|She gave up trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the benighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to their destiny by catch-words.
000173|The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk.
000174|But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters -- the enemy within.
000175|They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after virtue.
000176|As the years pass, they are censured.
000177|Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness hypocrisy;
000178|they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go.
