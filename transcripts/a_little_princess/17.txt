000001|The next afternoon three members of the Large Family sat in the Indian gentleman's library, doing their best to cheer him up.
000002|They had been allowed to come in to perform this office because he had specially invited them.
000003|He had been living in a state of suspense for some time, and today he was waiting for a certain event very anxiously.
000004|This event was the return of mister Carmichael from Moscow.
000005|His stay there had been prolonged from week to week.
000006|On his first arrival there, he had not been able satisfactorily to trace the family he had gone in search of.
000007|When he felt at last sure that he had found them and had gone to their house, he had been told that they were absent on a journey.
000008|His efforts to reach them had been unavailing, so he had decided to remain in Moscow until their return.
000009|mister Carrisford sat in his reclining chair, and Janet sat on the floor beside him.
000010|He was very fond of Janet.
000011|Nora had found a footstool, and Donald was astride the tiger's head which ornamented the rug made of the animal's skin.
000012|It must be owned that he was riding it rather violently.
000013|"Don't chirrup so loud, Donald," Janet said.
000014|When you come to cheer an ill person up you don't cheer him up at the top of your voice.
000015|"Perhaps cheering up is too loud, mister Carrisford?" turning to the Indian gentleman.
000016|But he only patted her shoulder.
000017|"No, it isn't," he answered.
000018|And it keeps me from thinking too much.
000019|"I'm going to be quiet," Donald shouted.
000020|We'll all be as quiet as mice.
000021|"Mice don't make a noise like that," said Janet.
000022|Donald made a bridle of his handkerchief and bounced up and down on the tiger's head.
000023|"A whole lot of mice might," he said cheerfully.
000024|A thousand mice might.
000025|"I don't believe fifty thousand mice would," said Janet, severely;
000026|and we have to be as quiet as one mouse.
000027|mister Carrisford laughed and patted her shoulder again.
000028|"Papa won't be very long now," she said.
000029|May we talk about the lost little girl?
000030|"I don't think I could talk much about anything else just now," the Indian gentleman answered, knitting his forehead with a tired look.
000031|"We like her so much," said Nora.
000032|We call her the little un-fairy princess.
000033|"Why?" the Indian gentleman inquired, because the fancies of the Large Family always made him forget things a little.
000034|It was Janet who answered.
000035|It is because, though she is not exactly a fairy, she will be so rich when she is found that she will be like a princess in a fairy tale.
000036|We called her the fairy princess at first, but it didn't quite suit.
000037|"Is it true," said Nora, "that her papa gave all his money to a friend to put in a mine that had diamonds in it, and then the friend thought he had lost it all and ran away because he felt as if he was a robber?"
000038|"But he wasn't really, you know," put in Janet, hastily.
000039|The Indian gentleman took hold of her hand quickly.
000040|"No, he wasn't really," he said.
000041|"I am sorry for the friend," Janet said;
000042|I can't help it.
000043|He didn't mean to do it, and it would break his heart.
000044|I am sure it would break his heart.
000045|"You are an understanding little woman, Janet," the Indian gentleman said, and he held her hand close.
000046|"Did you tell mister Carrisford," Donald shouted again, "about the little-girl-who-isn't-a-beggar?"
000047|Did you tell him she has new nice clothes?
000048|P'r'aps she's been found by somebody when she was lost.
000049|"There's a cab!" exclaimed Janet.
000050|It's stopping before the door.
000051|It is papa!
000052|They all ran to the windows to look out.
000053|"Yes, it's papa," Donald proclaimed.
000054|But there is no little girl.
000055|All three of them incontinently fled from the room and tumbled into the hall.
000056|It was in this way they always welcomed their father.
000057|They were to be heard jumping up and down, clapping their hands, and being caught up and kissed.
000058|mister Carrisford made an effort to rise and sank back again.
000059|"It is no use," he said.
000060|What a wreck I am!
000061|mister Carmichael's voice approached the door.
000062|"No, children," he was saying;
000063|you may come in after I have talked to mister Carrisford.
000064|Go and play with Ram Dass.
000065|Then the door opened and he came in.
000066|He looked rosier than ever, and brought an atmosphere of freshness and health with him;
000067|but his eyes were disappointed and anxious as they met the invalid's look of eager question even as they grasped each other's hands.
000068|"What news?" mister Carrisford asked.
000069|The child the Russian people adopted?
000070|"She is not the child we are looking for," was mister Carmichael's answer.
000071|She is much younger than Captain Crewe's little girl.
000072|Her name is Emily Carew.
000073|I have seen and talked to her.
000074|The Russians were able to give me every detail.
000075|How wearied and miserable the Indian gentleman looked!
000076|His hand dropped from mister Carmichael's.
000077|"Then the search has to be begun over again," he said.
000078|That is all.
000079|Please sit down.
000080|mister Carmichael took a seat.
000081|Somehow, he had gradually grown fond of this unhappy man.
000082|He was himself so well and happy, and so surrounded by cheerfulness and love, that desolation and broken health seemed pitifully unbearable things.
000083|If there had been the sound of just one gay little high-pitched voice in the house, it would have been so much less forlorn.
000084|And that a man should be compelled to carry about in his breast the thought that he had seemed to wrong and desert a child was not a thing one could face.
000085|"Come, come," he said in his cheery voice;
000086|we'll find her yet.
000087|We must begin at once.
000088|"No time must be lost," mister Carrisford fretted.
000089|Have you any new suggestion to make -- any whatsoever?
000090|mister Carmichael felt rather restless, and he rose and began to pace the room with a thoughtful, though uncertain face.
000091|"Well, perhaps," he said.
000092|I don't know what it may be worth.
000093|The fact is, an idea occurred to me as I was thinking the thing over in the train on the journey from Dover.
000094|What was it?
000095|If she is alive, she is somewhere.
000096|Yes;
000097|she is somewhere.
000098|We have searched the schools in Paris.
000099|Let us give up Paris and begin in London.
000100|That was my idea -- to search London.
000101|"There are schools enough in London," said mister Carrisford.
000102|Then he slightly started, roused by a recollection.
000103|By the way, there is one next door.
000104|Then we will begin there.
000105|We cannot begin nearer than next door.
000106|"No," said Carrisford.
000107|There is a child there who interests me;
000108|but she is not a pupil.
000109|And she is a little dark, forlorn creature, as unlike poor Crewe as a child could be.
000110|Perhaps the Magic was at work again at that very moment -- the beautiful Magic.
000111|It really seemed as if it might be so.
000112|What was it that brought Ram Dass into the room -- even as his master spoke -- salaaming respectfully, but with a scarcely concealed touch of excitement in his dark, flashing eyes?
000113|"Sahib," he said, "the child herself has come -- the child the sahib felt pity for."
000114|She brings back the monkey who had again run away to her attic under the roof.
000115|I have asked that she remain.
000116|It was my thought that it would please the sahib to see and speak with her.
000117|"Who is she?" inquired mister Carmichael.
000118|"God knows," mister Carrrisford answered.
000119|She is the child I spoke of.
000120|A little drudge at the school.
000121|He waved his hand to Ram Dass, and addressed him.
000122|Yes, I should like to see her.
000123|Go and bring her in.
000124|Then he turned to mister Carmichael.
000125|"While you have been away," he explained, "I have been desperate."
000126|The days were so dark and long.
000127|Ram Dass told me of this child's miseries, and together we invented a romantic plan to help her.
000128|I suppose it was a childish thing to do;
000129|but it gave me something to plan and think of.
000130|Without the help of an agile, soft-footed Oriental like Ram Dass, however, it could not have been done.
000131|Then Sara came into the room.
000132|She carried the monkey in her arms, and he evidently did not intend to part from her, if it could be helped.
000133|He was clinging to her and chattering, and the interesting excitement of finding herself in the Indian gentleman's room had brought a flush to Sara's cheeks.
000134|"Your monkey ran away again," she said, in her pretty voice.
000135|He came to my garret window last night, and I took him in because it was so cold.
000136|I would have brought him back if it had not been so late.
000137|I knew you were ill and might not like to be disturbed.
000138|The Indian gentleman's hollow eyes dwelt on her with curious interest.
000139|"That was very thoughtful of you," he said.
000140|Sara looked toward Ram Dass, who stood near the door.
000141|"Shall I give him to the Lascar?" she asked.
000142|"How do you know he is a Lascar?" said the Indian gentleman, smiling a little.
000143|"Oh, I know Lascars," Sara said, handing over the reluctant monkey.
000144|I was born in India.
000145|The Indian gentleman sat upright so suddenly, and with such a change of expression, that she was for a moment quite startled.
000146|"You were born in India," he exclaimed, "were you?"
000147|"Come here." And he held out his hand.
000148|Sara went to him and laid her hand in his, as he seemed to want to take it.
000149|She stood still, and her green-gray eyes met his wonderingly.
000150|Something seemed to be the matter with him.
000151|"You live next door?" he demanded.
000152|Yes;
000153|I live at Miss Minchin's seminary.
000154|But you are not one of her pupils?
000155|A strange little smile hovered about Sara's mouth.
000156|She hesitated a moment.
000157|"I don't think I know exactly what I am," she replied.
000158|Why not?
000159|At first I was a pupil, and a parlor boarder;
000160|but now
000161|You were a pupil!
000162|What are you now?
000163|The queer little sad smile was on Sara's lips again.
000164|"I sleep in the attic, next to the scullery maid," she said.
000165|I run errands for the cook -- I do anything she tells me;
000166|and I teach the little ones their lessons.
000167|"Question her, Carmichael," said mister Carrisford, sinking back as if he had lost his strength.
000168|Question her;
000169|I cannot.
000170|The big, kind father of the Large Family knew how to question little girls.
000171|Sara realized how much practice he had had when he spoke to her in his nice, encouraging voice.
000172|"What do you mean by 'At first,' my child?" he inquired.
000173|When I was first taken there by my papa.
000174|Where is your papa?
000175|"He died," said Sara, very quietly.
000176|He lost all his money and there was none left for me.
000177|There was no one to take care of me or to pay Miss Minchin.
000178|"Carmichael!" the Indian gentleman cried out loudly.
000179|Carmichael!
000180|"We must not frighten her," mister Carmichael said aside to him in a quick, low voice.
000181|And he added aloud to Sara, "So you were sent up into the attic, and made into a little drudge."
000182|That was about it, wasn't it?
000183|"There was no one to take care of me," said Sara.
000184|There was no money;
000185|I belong to nobody.
000186|"How did your father lose his money?" the Indian gentleman broke in breathlessly.
000187|"He did not lose it himself," Sara answered, wondering still more each moment.
000188|He had a friend he was very fond of -- he was very fond of him.
000189|It was his friend who took his money.
000190|He trusted his friend too much.
000191|The Indian gentleman's breath came more quickly.
000192|"The friend might have meant to do no harm," he said.
000193|It might have happened through a mistake.
000194|Sara did not know how unrelenting her quiet young voice sounded as she answered.
000195|If she had known, she would surely have tried to soften it for the Indian gentleman's sake.
000196|"The suffering was just as bad for my papa," she said.
000197|It killed him.
000198|"What was your father's name?" the Indian gentleman said.
000199|Tell me.
000200|"His name was Ralph Crewe," Sara answered, feeling startled.
000201|Captain Crewe.
000202|He died in India.
000203|The haggard face contracted, and Ram Dass sprang to his master's side.
000204|"Carmichael," the invalid gasped, "it is the child -- the child!"
000205|For a moment Sara thought he was going to die.
000206|Ram Dass poured out drops from a bottle, and held them to his lips.
000207|Sara stood near, trembling a little.
000208|She looked in a bewildered way at mister Carmichael.
000209|"What child am I?" she faltered.
000210|"He was your father's friend," mister Carmichael answered her.
000211|Don't be frightened.
000212|We have been looking for you for two years.
000213|Sara put her hand up to her forehead, and her mouth trembled.
000214|She spoke as if she were in a dream.
000215|"And I was at Miss Minchin's all the while," she half whispered.
