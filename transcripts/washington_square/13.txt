000001|it may be thought the Doctor was too positive, and misess Almond intimated as much.
000002|But, as he said, he had his impression;
000003|it seemed to him sufficient, and he had no wish to modify it.
000004|He had passed his life in estimating people (it was part of the medical trade), and in nineteen cases out of twenty he was right.
000005|"Perhaps mister Townsend is the twentieth case," misess Almond suggested.
000006|Perhaps he is, though he doesn't look to me at all like a twentieth case.
000007|But I will give him the benefit of the doubt, and, to make sure, I will go and talk with misess Montgomery.
000008|She will almost certainly tell me I have done right;
000009|but it is just possible that she will prove to me that I have made the greatest mistake of my life.
000010|If she does, I will beg mister Townsend's pardon.
000011|You needn't invite her to meet me, as you kindly proposed;
000012|I will write her a frank letter, telling her how matters stand, and asking leave to come and see her.
000013|I am afraid the frankness will be chiefly on your side.
000014|The poor little woman will stand up for her brother, whatever he may be.
000015|Whatever he may be?
000016|I doubt that.
000017|People are not always so fond of their brothers.
000018|"Ah," said misess Almond, "when it's a question of thirty thousand a year coming into a family -- "
000019|If she stands up for him on account of the money, she will be a humbug.
000020|If she is a humbug I shall see it.
000021|If I see it, I won't waste time with her.
000022|She is not a humbug -- she is an exemplary woman.
000023|She will not wish to play her brother a trick simply because he is selfish.
000024|If she is worth talking to, she will sooner play him a trick than that he should play Catherine one.
000025|Has she seen Catherine, by the way -- does she know her?
000026|Not to my knowledge.
000027|mister Townsend can have had no particular interest in bringing them together.
000028|If she is an exemplary woman, no.
000029|But we shall see to what extent she answers your description.
000030|"I shall be curious to hear her description of you!" said misess Almond, with a laugh.
000031|And, meanwhile, how is Catherine taking it?
000032|As she takes everything -- as a matter of course.
000033|Doesn't she make a noise?
000034|Hasn't she made a scene?
000035|She is not scenic.
000036|I thought a love-lorn maiden was always scenic.
000037|A fantastic widow is more so.
000038|Lavinia has made me a speech;
000039|she thinks me very arbitrary.
000040|"She has a talent for being in the wrong," said misess Almond.
000041|But I am very sorry for Catherine, all the same.
000042|So am I.
000043|But she will get over it.
000044|You believe she will give him up?
000045|I count upon it.
000046|She has such an admiration for her father.
000047|Oh, we know all about that!
000048|But it only makes me pity her the more.
000049|It makes her dilemma the more painful, and the effort of choosing between you and her lover almost impossible.
000050|If she can't choose, all the better.
000051|Yes, but he will stand there entreating her to choose, and Lavinia will pull on that side.
000052|I am glad she is not on my side;
000053|she is capable of ruining an excellent cause.
000054|The day Lavinia gets into your boat it capsizes.
000055|"But she had better be careful," said the Doctor.
000056|I will have no treason in my house!
000057|I suspect she will be careful;
000058|for she is at bottom very much afraid of you.
000059|"They are both afraid of me -- harmless as I am!" the Doctor answered.
