000001|her refreshed attention to this gentleman had not those limits of which Catherine desired, for herself, to be conscious;
000002|it lasted long enough to enable her to wait another week before speaking of him again.
000003|It was under the same circumstances that she once more attacked the subject.
000004|She had been sitting with her niece in the evening;
000005|only on this occasion, as the night was not so warm, the lamp had been lighted, and Catherine had placed herself near it with a morsel of fancy-work.
000006|misess Penniman went and sat alone for half an hour on the balcony;
000007|then she came in, moving vaguely about the room.
000008|At last she sank into a seat near Catherine, with clasped hands, and a little look of excitement.
000009|"Shall you be angry if I speak to you again about him?" she asked.
000010|Catherine looked up at her quietly.
000011|Who is he?
000012|He whom you once loved.
000013|I shall not be angry, but I shall not like it.
000014|"He sent you a message," said misess Penniman.
000015|I promised him to deliver it, and I must keep my promise.
000016|In all these years Catherine had had time to forget how little she had to thank her aunt for in the season of her misery;
000017|she had long ago forgiven misess Penniman for taking too much upon herself.
000018|But for a moment this attitude of interposition and disinterestedness, this carrying of messages and redeeming of promises, brought back the sense that her companion was a dangerous woman.
000019|She had said she would not be angry;
000020|but for an instant she felt sore.
000021|"I don't care what you do with your promise!" she answered.
000022|misess Penniman, however, with her high conception of the sanctity of pledges, carried her point.
000023|"I have gone too far to retreat," she said, though precisely what this meant she was not at pains to explain.
000024|mister Townsend wishes most particularly to see you, Catherine;
000025|he believes that if you knew how much, and why, he wishes it, you would consent to do so.
000026|"There can be no reason," said Catherine;
000027|no good reason.
000028|His happiness depends upon it.
000029|"Is not that a good reason?" asked misess Penniman impressively.
000030|Not for me.
000031|My happiness does not.
000032|I think you will be happier after you have seen him.
000033|He is going away again -- going to resume his wanderings.
000034|It is a very lonely, restless, joyless life.
000035|Before he goes he wishes to speak to you;
000036|it is a fixed idea with him -- he is always thinking of it.
000037|He has something very important to say to you.
000038|He believes that you never understood him -- that you never judged him rightly, and the belief has always weighed upon him terribly.
000039|He wishes to justify himself;
000040|he believes that in a very few words he could do so.
000041|He wishes to meet you as a friend.
000042|Catherine listened to this wonderful speech without pausing in her work;
000043|she had now had several days to accustom herself to think of Morris Townsend again as an actuality.
000044|When it was over she said simply, "Please say to mister Townsend that I wish he would leave me alone."
000045|She had hardly spoken when a sharp, firm ring at the door vibrated through the summer night.
000046|Catherine looked up at the clock;
000047|it marked a quarter-past nine -- a very late hour for visitors, especially in the empty condition of the town.
000048|misess Penniman at the same moment gave a little start, and then Catherine's eyes turned quickly to her aunt.
000049|They met misess Penniman's and sounded them for a moment, sharply.
000050|misess Penniman was blushing;
000051|her look was a conscious one;
000052|it seemed to confess something.
000053|Catherine guessed its meaning, and rose quickly from her chair.
000054|"Aunt Penniman," she said, in a tone that scared her companion, "have you taken the liberty ...?"
000055|"My dearest Catherine," stammered misess Penniman, "just wait till you see him!"
000056|Catherine had frightened her aunt, but she was also frightened herself;
000057|she was on the point of rushing to give orders to the servant, who was passing to the door, to admit no one;
000058|but the fear of meeting her visitor checked her.
000059|mister Morris Townsend.
000060|This was what she heard, vaguely but recognisably articulated by the domestic, while she hesitated.
000061|She had her back turned to the door of the parlour, and for some moments she kept it turned, feeling that he had come in.
000062|He had not spoken, however, and at last she faced about.
000063|Then she saw a gentleman standing in the middle of the room, from which her aunt had discreetly retired.
000064|She would never have known him.
000065|He was forty-five years old, and his figure was not that of the straight, slim young man she remembered.
000066|But it was a very fine person, and a fair and lustrous beard, spreading itself upon a well-presented chest, contributed to its effect.
000067|After a moment Catherine recognised the upper half of the face, which, though her visitor's clustering locks had grown thin, was still remarkably handsome.
000068|He stood in a deeply deferential attitude, with his eyes on her face.
000069|"I have ventured -- I have ventured," he said;
000070|and then he paused, looking about him, as if he expected her to ask him to sit down.
000071|It was the old voice, but it had not the old charm.
000072|Catherine, for a minute, was conscious of a distinct determination not to invite him to take a seat.
000073|Why had he come?
000074|It was wrong for him to come.
000075|Morris was embarrassed, but Catherine gave him no help.
000076|It was not that she was glad of his embarrassment;
000077|on the contrary, it excited all her own liabilities of this kind, and gave her great pain.
000078|But how could she welcome him when she felt so vividly that he ought not to have come?
000079|"I wanted so much -- I was determined," Morris went on.
000080|But he stopped again;
000081|it was not easy.
000082|Catherine still said nothing, and he may well have recalled with apprehension her ancient faculty of silence.
000083|She continued to look at him, however, and as she did so she made the strangest observation.
000084|It seemed to be he, and yet not he;
000085|it was the man who had been everything, and yet this person was nothing.
000086|How long ago it was -- how old she had grown -- how much she had lived!
000087|She had lived on something that was connected with him, and she had consumed it in doing so.
000088|This person did not look unhappy.
000089|He was fair and well-preserved, perfectly dressed, mature and complete.
000090|As Catherine looked at him, the story of his life defined itself in his eyes;
000091|he had made himself comfortable, and he had never been caught.
000092|But even while her perception opened itself to this, she had no desire to catch him;
000093|his presence was painful to her, and she only wished he would go.
000094|"Will you not sit down?" he asked.
000095|"I think we had better not," said Catherine.
000096|"I offend you by coming?" He was very grave;
000097|he spoke in a tone of the richest respect.
000098|I don't think you ought to have come.
000099|Did not misess Penniman tell you -- did she not give you my message?
000100|She told me something, but I did not understand.
000101|I wish you would let me tell you -- let me speak for myself.
000102|"I don't think it is necessary," said Catherine.
000103|Not for you, perhaps, but for me.
000104|It would be a great satisfaction -- and I have not many.
000105|He seemed to be coming nearer;
000106|Catherine turned away.
000107|"Can we not be friends again?" he said.
000108|"We are not enemies," said Catherine.
000109|I have none but friendly feelings to you.
000110|Ah, I wonder whether you know the happiness it gives me to hear you say that!
000111|Catherine uttered no intimation that she measured the influence of her words;
000112|and he presently went on, "You have not changed -- the years have passed happily for you."
000113|"They have passed very quietly," said Catherine.
000114|They have left no marks;
000115|you are admirably young.
000116|This time he succeeded in coming nearer -- he was close to her;
000117|she saw his glossy perfumed beard, and his eyes above it looking strange and hard.
000118|It was very different from his old -- from his young -- face.
000119|If she had first seen him this way she would not have liked him.
000120|It seemed to her that he was smiling, or trying to smile.
000121|"Catherine," he said, lowering his voice, "I have never ceased to think of you."
000122|"Please don't say those things," she answered.
000123|Do you hate me?
000124|"Oh no," said Catherine.
000125|Something in her tone discouraged him, but in a moment he recovered himself.
000126|Have you still some kindness for me, then?
000127|"I don't know why you have come here to ask me such things!" Catherine exclaimed.
000128|Because for many years it has been the desire of my life that we should be friends again.
000129|That is impossible.
000130|Why so?
000131|Not if you will allow it.
000132|"I will not allow it!" said Catherine.
000133|He looked at her again in silence.
000134|I see;
000135|my presence troubles you and pains you.
000136|I will go away;
000137|but you must give me leave to come again.
000138|"Please don't come again," she said.
000139|Never? -- never?
000140|She made a great effort;
000141|she wished to say something that would make it impossible he should ever again cross her threshold.
000142|It is wrong of you.
000143|There is no propriety in it -- no reason for it.
000144|"Ah, dearest lady, you do me injustice!" cried Morris Townsend.
000145|We have only waited, and now we are free.
000146|"You treated me badly," said Catherine.
000147|Not if you think of it rightly.
000148|You had your quiet life with your father -- which was just what I could not make up my mind to rob you of.
000149|Yes; I had that.
000150|Morris felt it to be a considerable damage to his cause that he could not add that she had had something more besides;
000151|for it is needless to say that he had learnt the contents of doctor Sloper's will.
000152|He was nevertheless not at a loss.
000153|"There are worse fates than that!" he exclaimed, with expression;
000154|and he might have been supposed to refer to his own unprotected situation.
000155|Then he added, with a deeper tenderness, "Catherine, have you never forgiven me?"
000156|I forgave you years ago, but it is useless for us to attempt to be friends.
000157|Not if we forget the past.
000158|We have still a future, thank God!
000159|"I can't forget -- I don't forget," said Catherine.
000160|You treated me too badly.
000161|I felt it very much;
000162|I felt it for years.
000163|And then she went on, with her wish to show him that he must not come to her this way, "I can't begin again -- I can't take it up."
000164|Everything is dead and buried.
000165|It was too serious;
000166|it made a great change in my life.
000167|I never expected to see you here.
000168|"Ah, you are angry!" cried Morris, who wished immensely that he could extort some flash of passion from her mildness.
000169|In that case he might hope.
000170|No, I am not angry.
000171|Anger does not last, that way, for years.
000172|But there are other things.
000173|Impressions last, when they have been strong.
000174|But I can't talk.
000175|Morris stood stroking his beard, with a clouded eye.
000176|"Why have you never married?" he asked abruptly.
000177|You have had opportunities.
000178|I didn't wish to marry.
000179|Yes, you are rich, you are free;
000180|you had nothing to gain.
000181|"I had nothing to gain," said Catherine.
000182|Morris looked vaguely round him, and gave a deep sigh.
000183|Well, I was in hopes that we might still have been friends.
000184|I meant to tell you, by my aunt, in answer to your message -- if you had waited for an answer -- that it was unnecessary for you to come in that hope.
000185|"Good-bye, then," said Morris.
000186|Excuse my indiscretion.
000187|He bowed, and she turned away -- standing there, averted, with her eyes on the ground, for some moments after she had heard him close the door of the room.
000188|In the hall he found misess Penniman, fluttered and eager;
000189|she appeared to have been hovering there under the irreconcilable promptings of her curiosity and her dignity.
000190|"That was a precious plan of yours!" said Morris, clapping on his hat.
000191|"Is she so hard?" asked misess Penniman.
000192|She doesn't care a button for me -- with her confounded little dry manner.
000193|"Was it very dry?" pursued misess Penniman, with solicitude.
000194|Morris took no notice of her question;
000195|he stood musing an instant, with his hat on.
000196|But why the deuce, then, would she never marry?
000197|"Yes -- why indeed?" sighed misess Penniman.
000198|And then, as if from a sense of the inadequacy of this explanation, "But you will not despair -- you will come back?"
000199|Come back?
000200|"Damnation!" And Morris Townsend strode out of the house, leaving misess Penniman staring.
