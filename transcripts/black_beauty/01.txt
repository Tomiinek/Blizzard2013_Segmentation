000001|The first place that I can well remember was a large pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it.
000002|Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and water-lilies grew at the deep end.
000003|Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master's house, which stood by the roadside;
000004|at the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank.
000005|While I was young I lived upon my mother's milk, as I could not eat grass.
000006|In the daytime I ran by her side, and at night I lay down close by her.
000007|When it was hot we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees, and when it was cold we had a nice warm shed near the grove.
000008|As soon as I was old enough to eat grass my mother used to go out to work in the daytime, and come back in the evening.
000009|There were six young colts in the meadow besides me;
000010|they were older than I was;
000011|some were nearly as large as grown-up horses.
000012|I used to run with them, and had great fun;
000013|we used to gallop all together round and round the field as hard as we could go.
000014|Sometimes we had rather rough play, for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop.
000015|One day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother whinnied to me to come to her, and then she said:
000016|I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you.
000017|The colts who live here are very good colts, but they are cart-horse colts, and of course they have not learned manners.
000018|You have been well-bred and well-born;
000019|your father has a great name in these parts, and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races;
000020|your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew, and I think you have never seen me kick or bite.
000021|I hope you will grow up gentle and good, and never learn bad ways;
000022|do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you trot, and never bite or kick even in play.
000023|I have never forgotten my mother's advice;
000024|I knew she was a wise old horse, and our master thought a great deal of her.
000025|Her name was Duchess, but he often called her Pet.
000026|Our master was a good, kind man.
000027|He gave us good food, good lodging, and kind words;
000028|he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children.
000029|We were all fond of him, and my mother loved him very much.
000030|When she saw him at the gate she would neigh with joy, and trot up to him.
000031|He would pat and stroke her and say, "Well, old Pet, and how is your little Darkie?"
000032|I was a dull black, so he called me Darkie;
000033|then he would give me a piece of bread, which was very good, and sometimes he brought a carrot for my mother.
000034|All the horses would come to him, but I think we were his favorites.
000035|My mother always took him to the town on a market day in a light gig.
000036|There was a plowboy, Dick, who sometimes came into our field to pluck blackberries from the hedge.
000037|When he had eaten all he wanted he would have what he called fun with the colts, throwing stones and sticks at them to make them gallop.
000038|We did not much mind him, for we could gallop off;
000039|but sometimes a stone would hit and hurt us.
000040|One day he was at this game, and did not know that the master was in the next field;
000041|but he was there, watching what was going on;
000042|over the hedge he jumped in a snap, and catching Dick by the arm, he gave him such a box on the ear as made him roar with the pain and surprise.
000043|As soon as we saw the master we trotted up nearer to see what went on.
000044|"Bad boy!" he said, "bad boy! to chase the colts."
000045|This is not the first time, nor the second, but it shall be the last.
000046|There -- take your money and go home;
000047|I shall not want you on my farm again.
000048|So we never saw Dick any more.
