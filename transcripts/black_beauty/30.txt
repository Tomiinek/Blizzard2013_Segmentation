000001|My new master was an unmarried man.
000002|He lived at Bath, and was much engaged in business.
000003|His doctor advised him to take horse exercise, and for this purpose he bought me.
000004|He hired a stable a short distance from his lodgings, and engaged a man named Filcher as groom.
000005|My master knew very little about horses, but he treated me well, and I should have had a good and easy place but for circumstances of which he was ignorant.
000006|He ordered the best hay with plenty of oats, crushed beans, and bran, with vetches, or rye grass, as the man might think needful.
000007|I heard the master give the order, so I knew there was plenty of good food, and I thought I was well off.
000008|For a few days all went on well.
000009|I found that my groom understood his business.
000010|He kept the stable clean and airy, and he groomed me thoroughly;
000011|and was never otherwise than gentle.
000012|He had been an hostler in one of the great hotels in Bath.
000013|He had given that up, and now cultivated fruit and vegetables for the market, and his wife bred and fattened poultry and rabbits for sale.
000014|After awhile it seemed to me that my oats came very short;
000015|I had the beans, but bran was mixed with them instead of oats, of which there were very few;
000016|certainly not more than a quarter of what there should have been.
000017|In two or three weeks this began to tell upon my strength and spirits.
000018|The grass food, though very good, was not the thing to keep up my condition without corn.
000019|However, I could not complain, nor make known my wants.
000020|So it went on for about two months;
000021|and I wondered that my master did not see that something was the matter.
000022|However, one afternoon he rode out into the country to see a friend of his, a gentleman farmer, who lived on the road to Wells.
000023|This gentleman had a very quick eye for horses;
000024|and after he had welcomed his friend he said, casting his eye over me:
000025|It seems to me, Barry, that your horse does not look so well as he did when you first had him;
000026|has he been well?
000027|"Yes, I believe so," said my master;
000028|but he is not nearly so lively as he was;
000029|my groom tells me that horses are always dull and weak in the autumn, and that I must expect it.
000030|"Autumn, fiddlesticks!" said the farmer.
000031|Why, this is only August;
000032|and with your light work and good food he ought not to go down like this, even if it was autumn.
000033|How do you feed him?
000034|My master told him.
000035|The other shook his head slowly, and began to feel me over.
000036|I can't say who eats your corn, my dear fellow, but I am much mistaken if your horse gets it.
000037|Have you ridden very fast?
000038|No, very gently.
000039|"Then just put your hand here," said he, passing his hand over my neck and shoulder;
000040|he is as warm and damp as a horse just come up from grass.
000041|I advise you to look into your stable a little more.
000042|I hate to be suspicious, and, thank heaven, I have no cause to be, for I can trust my men, present or absent;
000043|but there are mean scoundrels, wicked enough to rob a dumb beast of his food.
000044|You must look into it.
000045|And turning to his man, who had come to take me, "Give this horse a right good feed of bruised oats, and don't stint him."
000046|Dumb beasts!
000047|Yes, we are;
000048|but if I could have spoken I could have told my master where his oats went to.
000049|My groom used to come every morning about six o'clock, and with him a little boy, who always had a covered basket with him.
000050|He used to go with his father into the harness-room, where the corn was kept, and I could see them, when the door stood ajar, fill a little bag with oats out of the bin, and then he used to be off.
000051|Five or six mornings after this, just as the boy had left the stable, the door was pushed open, and a policeman walked in, holding the child tight by the arm;
000052|another policeman followed, and locked the door on the inside, saying, "Show me the place where your father keeps his rabbits' food."
000053|The boy looked very frightened and began to cry;
000054|but there was no escape, and he led the way to the corn-bin.
000055|Here the policeman found another empty bag like that which was found full of oats in the boy's basket.
000056|Filcher was cleaning my feet at the time, but they soon saw him, and though he blustered a good deal they walked him off to the 'lock-up', and his boy with him.
