000001|I was sold to a corn dealer and baker, whom Jerry knew, and with him he thought I should have good food and fair work.
000002|In the first he was quite right, and if my master had always been on the premises I do not think I should have been overloaded, but there was a foreman who was always hurrying and driving every one, and frequently when I had quite a full load he would order something else to be taken on.
000003|My carter, whose name was Jakes, often said it was more than I ought to take, but the other always overruled him.
000004|'Twas no use going twice when once would do, and he chose to get business forward.
000005|Jakes, like the other carters, always had the check-rein up, which prevented me from drawing easily, and by the time I had been there three or four months I found the work telling very much on my strength.
000006|One day I was loaded more than usual, and part of the road was a steep uphill.
000007|I used all my strength, but I could not get on, and was obliged continually to stop.
000008|This did not please my driver, and he laid his whip on badly.
000009|"Get on, you lazy fellow," he said, "or I'll make you."
000010|Again I started the heavy load, and struggled on a few yards;
000011|again the whip came down, and again I struggled forward.
000012|The pain of that great cart whip was sharp, but my mind was hurt quite as much as my poor sides.
000013|To be punished and abused when I was doing my very best was so hard it took the heart out of me.
000014|A third time he was flogging me cruelly, when a lady stepped quickly up to him, and said in a sweet, earnest voice:
000015|Oh! pray do not whip your good horse any more;
000016|I am sure he is doing all he can, and the road is very steep;
000017|I am sure he is doing his best.
000018|If doing his best won't get this load up he must do something more than his best;
000019|"that's all I know, ma'am," said Jakes.
000020|"But is it not a heavy load?" she said.
000021|"Yes, yes, too heavy," he said;
000022|but that's not my fault;
000023|the foreman came just as we were starting, and would have three hundredweight more put on to save him trouble, and I must get on with it as well as I can.
000024|He was raising the whip again, when the lady said:
000025|Pray, stop;
000026|I think I can help you if you will let me.
000027|The man laughed.
000028|"You see," she said, "you do not give him a fair chance;"
000029|he cannot use all his power with his head held back as it is with that check-rein;
000030|"if you would take it off I am sure he would do better -- do try it," she said persuasively, "I should be very glad if you would."
000031|"Well, well," said Jakes, with a short laugh, "anything to please a lady, of course."
000032|How far would you wish it down, ma'am?
000033|Quite down, give him his head altogether.
000034|The rein was taken off, and in a moment I put my head down to my very knees.
000035|What a comfort it was!
000036|Then I tossed it up and down several times to get the aching stiffness out of my neck.
000037|"Poor fellow! that is what you wanted," said she, patting and stroking me with her gentle hand;
000038|and now if you will speak kindly to him and lead him on I believe he will be able to do better.
000039|Jakes took the rein.
000040|Come on, Blackie.
000041|I put down my head, and threw my whole weight against the collar;
000042|I spared no strength;
000043|the load moved on, and I pulled it steadily up the hill, and then stopped to take breath.
000044|The lady had walked along the footpath, and now came across into the road.
000045|She stroked and patted my neck, as I had not been patted for many a long day.
000046|You see he was quite willing when you gave him the chance;
000047|I am sure he is a fine-tempered creature, and I dare say has known better days.
000048|"You won't put that rein on again, will you?" for he was just going to hitch it up on the old plan.
000049|Well, ma'am, I can't deny that having his head has helped him up the hill, and I'll remember it another time, and thank you, ma'am;
000050|but if he went without a check-rein I should be the laughing-stock of all the carters;
000051|it is the fashion, you see.
000052|"Is it not better," she said, "to lead a good fashion than to follow a bad one?"
000053|A great many gentlemen do not use check-reins now;
000054|our carriage horses have not worn them for fifteen years, and work with much less fatigue than those who have them;
000055|"besides," she added in a very serious voice, "we have no right to distress any of God's creatures without a very good reason;"
000056|we call them dumb animals, and so they are, for they cannot tell us how they feel, but they do not suffer less because they have no words.
000057|But I must not detain you now;
000058|I thank you for trying my plan with your good horse, and I am sure you will find it far better than the whip.
000059|"Good-day," and with another soft pat on my neck she stepped lightly across the path, and I saw her no more.
000060|"That was a real lady, I'll be bound for it," said Jakes to himself;
000061|"she spoke just as polite as if I was a gentleman, and I'll try her plan, uphill, at any rate;" and I must do him the justice to say that he let my rein out several holes, and going uphill after that, he always gave me my head;
000062|but the heavy loads went on.
000063|Good feed and fair rest will keep up one's strength under full work, but no horse can stand against overloading;
000064|and I was getting so thoroughly pulled down from this cause that a younger horse was bought in my place.
000065|I may as well mention here what I suffered at this time from another cause.
000066|I had heard horses speak of it, but had never myself had experience of the evil;
000067|this was a badly-lighted stable;
000068|there was only one very small window at the end, and the consequence was that the stalls were almost dark.
000069|Besides the depressing effect this had on my spirits, it very much weakened my sight, and when I was suddenly brought out of the darkness into the glare of daylight it was very painful to my eyes.
000070|Several times I stumbled over the threshold, and could scarcely see where I was going.
000071|I believe, had I stayed there very long, I should have become purblind, and that would have been a great misfortune, for I have heard men say that a stone-blind horse was safer to drive than one which had imperfect sight, as it generally makes them very timid.
