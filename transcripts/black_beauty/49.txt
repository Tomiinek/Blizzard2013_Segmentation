000001|One day during this summer the groom cleaned and dressed me with such extraordinary care that I thought some new change must be at hand;
000002|he trimmed my fetlocks and legs, passed the tarbrush over my hoofs, and even parted my forelock.
000003|I think the harness had an extra polish.
000004|Willie seemed half-anxious, half-merry, as he got into the chaise with his grandfather.
000005|"If the ladies take to him," said the old gentleman, "they'll be suited and he'll be suited."
000006|We can but try.
000007|At the distance of a mile or two from the village we came to a pretty, low house, with a lawn and shrubbery at the front and a drive up to the door.
000008|Willie rang the bell, and asked if Miss Blomefield or Miss Ellen was at home.
000009|Yes, they were.
000010|So, while Willie stayed with me, mister Thoroughgood went into the house.
000011|In about ten minutes he returned, followed by three ladies;
000012|one tall, pale lady, wrapped in a white shawl, leaned on a younger lady, with dark eyes and a merry face;
000013|the other, a very stately-looking person, was Miss Blomefield.
000014|They all came and looked at me and asked questions.
000015|The younger lady -- that was Miss Ellen -- took to me very much;
000016|she said she was sure she should like me, I had such a good face.
000017|The tall, pale lady said that she should always be nervous in riding behind a horse that had once been down, as I might come down again, and if I did she should never get over the fright.
000018|"You see, ladies," said mister Thoroughgood, "many first-rate horses have had their knees broken through the carelessness of their drivers without any fault of their own, and from what I see of this horse I should say that is his case;"
000019|but of course I do not wish to influence you.
000020|If you incline you can have him on trial, and then your coachman will see what he thinks of him.
000021|"You have always been such a good adviser to us about our horses," said the stately lady, "that your recommendation would go a long way with me, and if my sister Lavinia sees no objection we will accept your offer of a trial, with thanks."
000022|It was then arranged that I should be sent for the next day.
000023|In the morning a smart-looking young man came for me.
000024|At first he looked pleased;
000025|but when he saw my knees he said in a disappointed voice:
000026|I didn't think, sir, you would have recommended my ladies a blemished horse like that.
000027|"'Handsome is that handsome does'," said my master;
000028|you are only taking him on trial, and I am sure you will do fairly by him, young man.
000029|If he is not as safe as any horse you ever drove send him back.
000030|I was led to my new home, placed in a comfortable stable, fed, and left to myself.
000031|The next day, when the groom was cleaning my face, he said:
000032|That is just like the star that 'Black Beauty' had;
000033|he is much the same height, too.
000034|I wonder where he is now.
000035|A little further on he came to the place in my neck where I was bled and where a little knot was left in the skin.
000036|He almost started, and began to look me over carefully, talking to himself.
000037|"White star in the forehead, one white foot on the off side, this little knot just in that place;" then looking at the middle of my back -- "and, as I am alive, there is that little patch of white hair that John used to call 'Beauty's three-penny bit'."
000038|It must be 'Black Beauty'!
000039|Why, Beauty! Beauty! do you know me? -- little Joe Green, that almost killed you?
000040|And he began patting and patting me as if he was quite overjoyed.
000041|I could not say that I remembered him, for now he was a fine grown young fellow, with black whiskers and a man's voice, but I was sure he knew me, and that he was Joe Green, and I was very glad.
000042|I put my nose up to him, and tried to say that we were friends.
000043|I never saw a man so pleased.
000044|Give you a fair trial!
000045|I should think so indeed!
000046|I wonder who the rascal was that broke your knees, my old Beauty!
000047|you must have been badly served out somewhere;
000048|well, well, it won't be my fault if you haven't good times of it now.
000049|I wish John Manly was here to see you.
000050|In the afternoon I was put into a low park chair and brought to the door.
000051|Miss Ellen was going to try me, and Green went with her.
000052|I soon found that she was a good driver, and she seemed pleased with my paces.
000053|I heard Joe telling her about me, and that he was sure I was Squire Gordon's old "Black Beauty".
000054|When we returned the other sisters came out to hear how I had behaved myself.
000055|She told them what she had just heard, and said:
000056|I shall certainly write to misess Gordon, and tell her that her favorite horse has come to us.
000057|How pleased she will be!
000058|After this I was driven every day for a week or so, and as I appeared to be quite safe, Miss Lavinia at last ventured out in the small close carriage.
000059|After this it was quite decided to keep me and call me by my old name of "Black Beauty".
000060|I have now lived in this happy place a whole year.
000061|Joe is the best and kindest of grooms.
000062|My work is easy and pleasant, and I feel my strength and spirits all coming back again.
000063|mister Thoroughgood said to Joe the other day:
000064|In your place he will last till he is twenty years old -- perhaps more.
000065|Willie always speaks to me when he can, and treats me as his special friend.
000066|My ladies have promised that I shall never be sold, and so I have nothing to fear;
000067|and here my story ends.
000068|My troubles are all over, and I am at home;
