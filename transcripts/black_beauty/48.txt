000001|At this sale, of course I found myself in company with the old broken-down horses -- some lame, some broken-winded, some old, and some that I am sure it would have been merciful to shoot.
000002|The buyers and sellers, too, many of them, looked not much better off than the poor beasts they were bargaining about.
000003|There were poor old men, trying to get a horse or a pony for a few pounds, that might drag about some little wood or coal cart.
000004|There were poor men trying to sell a worn-out beast for two or three pounds, rather than have the greater loss of killing him.
000005|Some of them looked as if poverty and hard times had hardened them all over;
000006|but there were others that I would have willingly used the last of my strength in serving;
000007|poor and shabby, but kind and human, with voices that I could trust.
000008|There was one tottering old man who took a great fancy to me, and I to him, but I was not strong enough -- it was an anxious time!
000009|Coming from the better part of the fair, I noticed a man who looked like a gentleman farmer, with a young boy by his side;
000010|he had a broad back and round shoulders, a kind, ruddy face, and he wore a broad-brimmed hat.
000011|When he came up to me and my companions he stood still and gave a pitiful look round upon us.
000012|I saw his eye rest on me;
000013|I had still a good mane and tail, which did something for my appearance.
000014|I pricked my ears and looked at him.
000015|There's a horse, Willie, that has known better days.
000016|"Poor old fellow!" said the boy, "do you think, grandpapa, he was ever a carriage horse?"
000017|"Oh, yes! my boy," said the farmer, coming closer, "he might have been anything when he was young;"
000018|look at his nostrils and his ears, the shape of his neck and shoulder;
000019|there's a deal of breeding about that horse.
000020|He put out his hand and gave me a kind pat on the neck.
000021|I put out my nose in answer to his kindness;
000022|the boy stroked my face.
000023|Poor old fellow!
000024|see, grandpapa, how well he understands kindness.
000025|Could not you buy him and make him young again as you did with Ladybird?
000026|My dear boy, I can't make all old horses young;
000027|besides, Ladybird was not so very old, as she was run down and badly used.
000028|Well, grandpapa, I don't believe that this one is old;
000029|look at his mane and tail.
000030|I wish you would look into his mouth, and then you could tell;
000031|though he is so very thin, his eyes are not sunk like some old horses'.
000032|The old gentleman laughed.
000033|Bless the boy!
000034|he is as horsey as his old grandfather.
000035|But do look at his mouth, grandpapa, and ask the price;
000036|I am sure he would grow young in our meadows.
000037|The man who had brought me for sale now put in his word.
000038|The young gentleman's a real knowing one, sir.
000039|Now the fact is, this 'ere hoss is just pulled down with overwork in the cabs;
000040|he's not an old one, and I heerd as how the vetenary should say, that a six months' run off would set him right up, being as how his wind was not broken.
000041|I've had the tending of him these ten days past, and a gratefuller, pleasanter animal I never met with, and 'twould be worth a gentleman's while to give a five-pound note for him, and let him have a chance.
000042|I'll be bound he'd be worth twenty pounds next spring.
000043|The old gentleman laughed, and the little boy looked up eagerly.
000044|Oh, grandpapa, did you not say the colt sold for five pounds more than you expected?
000045|You would not be poorer if you did buy this one.
000046|The farmer slowly felt my legs, which were much swelled and strained;
000047|then he looked at my mouth.
000048|Thirteen or fourteen, I should say;
000049|just trot him out, will you?
000050|I arched my poor thin neck, raised my tail a little, and threw out my legs as well as I could, for they were very stiff.
000051|"What is the lowest you will take for him?" said the farmer as I came back.
000052|Five pounds, sir;
000053|that was the lowest price my master set.
000054|"'Tis a speculation," said the old gentleman, shaking his head, but at the same time slowly drawing out his purse, "quite a speculation!"
000055|"Have you any more business here?" he said, counting the sovereigns into his hand.
000056|No, sir, I can take him for you to the inn, if you please.
000057|Do so, I am now going there.
000058|They walked forward, and I was led behind.
000059|The boy could hardly control his delight, and the old gentleman seemed to enjoy his pleasure.
000060|I had a good feed at the inn, and was then gently ridden home by a servant of my new master's, and turned into a large meadow with a shed in one corner of it.
000061|mister Thoroughgood, for that was the name of my benefactor, gave orders that I should have hay and oats every night and morning, and the run of the meadow during the day, and, "you, Willie," said he, "must take the oversight of him;"
000062|I give him in charge to you.
000063|The boy was proud of his charge, and undertook it in all seriousness.
000064|There was not a day when he did not pay me a visit;
000065|sometimes picking me out from among the other horses, and giving me a bit of carrot, or something good, or sometimes standing by me while I ate my oats.
000066|He always came with kind words and caresses, and of course I grew very fond of him.
000067|He called me Old Crony, as I used to come to him in the field and follow him about.
000068|Sometimes he brought his grandfather, who always looked closely at my legs.
000069|"This is our point, Willie," he would say;
000070|but he is improving so steadily that I think we shall see a change for the better in the spring.
000071|The perfect rest, the good food, the soft turf, and gentle exercise, soon began to tell on my condition and my spirits.
000072|I had a good constitution from my mother, and I was never strained when I was young, so that I had a better chance than many horses who have been worked before they came to their full strength.
000073|During the winter my legs improved so much that I began to feel quite young again.
000074|The spring came round, and one day in March mister Thoroughgood determined that he would try me in the phaeton.
000075|I was well pleased, and he and Willie drove me a few miles.
000076|My legs were not stiff now, and I did the work with perfect ease.
000077|He's growing young, Willie;
000078|we must give him a little gentle work now, and by mid-summer he will be as good as Ladybird.
000079|He has a beautiful mouth and good paces;
000080|they can't be better.
000081|Oh, grandpapa, how glad I am you bought him!
000082|So am I, my boy;
000083|but he has to thank you more than me;
