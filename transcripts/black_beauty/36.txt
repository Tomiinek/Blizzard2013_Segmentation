000001|One morning, as Jerry had just put me into the shafts and was fastening the traces, a gentleman walked into the yard.
000002|"Your servant, sir," said Jerry.
000003|"Good-morning, mister Barker," said the gentleman.
000004|I should be glad to make some arrangements with you for taking misess Briggs regularly to church on Sunday mornings.
000005|We go to the New Church now, and that is rather further than she can walk.
000006|"Thank you, sir," said Jerry, "but I have only taken out a six-days' license, and therefore I could not take a fare on a Sunday;"
000007|it would not be legal.
000008|A few years since the annual charge for a cab license was very much reduced, and the difference between the six and seven days' cabs was abolished.
000009|"Oh!" said the other, "I did not know yours was a six-days' cab;"
000010|but of course it would be very easy to alter your license.
000011|I would see that you did not lose by it;
000012|the fact is, misess Briggs very much prefers you to drive her.
000013|I should be glad to oblige the lady, sir, but I had a seven-days' license once, and the work was too hard for me, and too hard for my horses.
000014|Year in and year out, not a day's rest, and never a Sunday with my wife and children;
000015|and never able to go to a place of worship, which I had always been used to do before I took to the driving box.
000016|So for the last five years I have only taken a six-days' license, and I find it better all the way round.
000017|"Well, of course," replied mister Briggs, "it is very proper that every person should have rest, and be able to go to church on Sundays, but I should have thought you would not have minded such a short distance for the horse, and only once a day;"
000018|you would have all the afternoon and evening for yourself, and we are very good customers, you know.
000019|Yes, sir, that is true, and I am grateful for all favors, I am sure;
000020|and anything that I could do to oblige you, or the lady, I should be proud and happy to do;
000021|but I can't give up my Sundays, sir, indeed I can't.
000022|I read that God made man, and he made horses and all the other beasts, and as soon as He had made them He made a day of rest, and bade that all should rest one day in seven;
000023|and I think, sir, He must have known what was good for them, and I am sure it is good for me;
000024|I am stronger and healthier altogether, now that I have a day of rest;
000025|the horses are fresh too, and do not wear up nearly so fast.
000026|The six-day drivers all tell me the same, and I have laid by more money in the savings bank than ever I did before;
000027|and as for the wife and children, sir, why, heart alive!
000028|they would not go back to the seven days for all they could see.
000029|"Oh, very well," said the gentleman.
000030|Don't trouble yourself, mister Barker, any further.
000031|"I will inquire somewhere else," and he walked away.
000032|"Well," says Jerry to me, "we can't help it, Jack, old boy;"
000033|we must have our Sundays.
000034|"Polly!" he shouted, "Polly! come here."
000035|She was there in a minute.
000036|What is it all about, Jerry?
000037|Why, my dear, mister Briggs wants me to take misess Briggs to church every Sunday morning.
000038|I say I have only a six-days' license.
000039|He says, 'Get a seven-days' license, and I'll make it worth your while;' and you know, Polly, they are very good customers to us.
000040|misess Briggs often goes out shopping for hours, or making calls, and then she pays down fair and honorable like a lady;
000041|there's no beating down or making three hours into two hours and a half, as some folks do;
000042|and it is easy work for the horses;
000043|not like tearing along to catch trains for people that are always a quarter of an hour too late;
000044|and if I don't oblige her in this matter it is very likely we shall lose them altogether.
000045|What do you say, little woman?
000046|"I say, Jerry," says she, speaking very slowly, "I say, if misess Briggs would give you a sovereign every Sunday morning, I would not have you a seven-days' cabman again."
000047|We have known what it was to have no Sundays, and now we know what it is to call them our own.
000048|Thank God, you earn enough to keep us, though it is sometimes close work to pay for all the oats and hay, the license, and the rent besides;
000049|but Harry will soon be earning something, and I would rather struggle on harder than we do than go back to those horrid times when you hardly had a minute to look at your own children, and we never could go to a place of worship together, or have a happy, quiet day.
000050|God forbid that we should ever turn back to those times;
000051|that's what I say, Jerry.
000052|"And that is just what I told mister Briggs, my dear," said Jerry, "and what I mean to stick to."
000053|"So don't go and fret yourself, Polly" (for she had begun to cry);
000054|I would not go back to the old times if I earned twice as much, so that is settled, little woman.
000055|Now, cheer up, and I'll be off to the stand.
000056|Three weeks had passed away after this conversation, and no order had come from misess Briggs;
000057|so there was nothing but taking jobs from the stand.
000058|Jerry took it to heart a good deal, for of course the work was harder for horse and man.
000059|But Polly would always cheer him up, and say, "Never mind, father, never, mind."
000060|'Do your best, and leave the rest, 'twill all come right Some day or night.'
000061|It soon became known that Jerry had lost his best customer, and for what reason.
000062|Most of the men said he was a fool, but two or three took his part.
000063|"If workingmen don't stick to their Sunday," said Truman, "they'll soon have none left;"
000064|it is every man's right and every beast's right.
000065|By God's law we have a day of rest, and by the law of England we have a day of rest;
000066|and I say we ought to hold to the rights these laws give us and keep them for our children.
000067|"All very well for you religious chaps to talk so," said Larry;
000068|but I'll turn a shilling when I can.
000069|I don't believe in religion, for I don't see that your religious people are any better than the rest.
000070|"If they are not better," put in Jerry, "it is because they are not religious."
000071|You might as well say that our country's laws are not good because some people break them.
000072|If a man gives way to his temper, and speaks evil of his neighbor, and does not pay his debts, he is not religious, I don't care how much he goes to church.
000073|If some men are shams and humbugs, that does not make religion untrue.
000074|Real religion is the best and truest thing in the world, and the only thing that can make a man really happy or make the world we live in any better.
000075|"If religion was good for anything," said Jones, "it would prevent your religious people from making us work on Sundays, as you know many of them do, and that's why I say religion is nothing but a sham;
000076|why, if it was not for the church and chapel-goers it would be hardly worth while our coming out on a Sunday.
000077|But they have their privileges, as they call them, and I go without.
000078|I shall expect them to answer for my soul, if I can't get a chance of saving it.
000079|Several of the men applauded this, till Jerry said:
000080|That may sound well enough, but it won't do;
000081|every man must look after his own soul;
000082|you can't lay it down at another man's door like a foundling and expect him to take care of it;
000083|and don't you see, if you are always sitting on your box waiting for a fare, they will say, 'If we don't take him some one else will, and he does not look for any Sunday.'
000084|Of course, they don't go to the bottom of it, or they would see if they never came for a cab it would be no use your standing there;
000085|but people don't always like to go to the bottom of things;
000086|it may not be convenient to do it;
000087|but if you Sunday drivers would all strike for a day of rest the thing would be done.
000088|"And what would all the good people do if they could not get to their favorite preachers?" said Larry.
000089|"'Tis not for me to lay down plans for other people," said Jerry, "but if they can't walk so far they can go to what is nearer;"
000090|and if it should rain they can put on their mackintoshes as they do on a week-day.
000091|If a thing is right it can be done, and if it is wrong it can be done without;
000092|and a good man will find a way.
