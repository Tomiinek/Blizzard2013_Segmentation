000001|It must have been nearly midnight when I heard at a great distance the sound of a horse's feet.
000002|Sometimes the sound died away, then it grew clearer again and nearer.
000003|The road to Earlshall led through woods that belonged to the earl;
000004|the sound came in that direction, and I hoped it might be some one coming in search of us.
000005|As the sound came nearer and nearer I was almost sure I could distinguish Ginger's step;
000006|a little nearer still, and I could tell she was in the dog-cart.
000007|I neighed loudly, and was overjoyed to hear an answering neigh from Ginger, and men's voices.
000008|They came slowly over the stones, and stopped at the dark figure that lay upon the ground.
000009|One of the men jumped out, and stooped down over it.
000010|"It is Reuben," he said, "and he does not stir!"
000011|The other man followed, and bent over him.
000012|"He's dead," he said;
000013|feel how cold his hands are.
000014|They raised him up, but there was no life, and his hair was soaked with blood.
000015|They laid him down again, and came and looked at me.
000016|They soon saw my cut knees.
000017|Why, the horse has been down and thrown him!
000018|Who would have thought the black horse would have done that?
000019|Nobody thought he could fall.
000020|Reuben must have been lying here for hours!
000021|Odd, too, that the horse has not moved from the place.
000022|Robert then attempted to lead me forward.
000023|I made a step, but almost fell again.
000024|Halloo! he's bad in his foot as well as his knees.
000025|Look here -- his hoof is cut all to pieces;
000026|he might well come down, poor fellow!
000027|I tell you what, Ned, I'm afraid it hasn't been all right with Reuben.
000028|Just think of his riding a horse over these stones without a shoe!
000029|Why, if he had been in his right senses he would just as soon have tried to ride him over the moon.
000030|I'm afraid it has been the old thing over again.
000031|Poor Susan! she looked awfully pale when she came to my house to ask if he had not come home.
000032|She made believe she was not a bit anxious, and talked of a lot of things that might have kept him.
000033|But for all that she begged me to go and meet him.
000034|But what must we do?
000035|There's the horse to get home as well as the body, and that will be no easy matter.
000036|Then followed a conversation between them, till it was agreed that Robert, as the groom, should lead me, and that Ned must take the body.
000037|It was a hard job to get it into the dog-cart, for there was no one to hold Ginger;
000038|but she knew as well as I did what was going on, and stood as still as a stone.
000039|I noticed that, because, if she had a fault, it was that she was impatient in standing.
000040|Ned started off very slowly with his sad load, and Robert came and looked at my foot again;
000041|then he took his handkerchief and bound it closely round, and so he led me home.
000042|I shall never forget that night walk;
000043|it was more than three miles.
000044|Robert led me on very slowly, and I limped and hobbled on as well as I could with great pain.
000045|I am sure he was sorry for me, for he often patted and encouraged me, talking to me in a pleasant voice.
000046|At last I reached my own box, and had some corn;
000047|and after Robert had wrapped up my knees in wet cloths, he tied up my foot in a bran poultice, to draw out the heat and cleanse it before the horse-doctor saw it in the morning, and I managed to get myself down on the straw, and slept in spite of the pain.
000048|The next day after the farrier had examined my wounds, he said he hoped the joint was not injured;
000049|and if so, I should not be spoiled for work, but I should never lose the blemish.
000050|I believe they did the best to make a good cure, but it was a long and painful one.
000051|Proud flesh, as they called it, came up in my knees, and was burned out with caustic;
000052|and when at last it was healed, they put a blistering fluid over the front of both knees to bring all the hair off;
000053|they had some reason for this, and I suppose it was all right.
000054|As Smith's death had been so sudden, and no one was there to see it, there was an inquest held.
000055|The landlord and hostler at the White Lion, with several other people, gave evidence that he was intoxicated when he started from the inn.
000056|The keeper of the toll-gate said he rode at a hard gallop through the gate;
000057|and my shoe was picked up among the stones, so that the case was quite plain to them, and I was cleared of all blame.
000058|Everybody pitied Susan.
000059|She was nearly out of her mind;
000060|she kept saying over and over again, "Oh! he was so good -- so good!"
000061|It was all that cursed drink;
000062|why will they sell that cursed drink?
000063|Oh Reuben, Reuben!
000064|So she went on till after he was buried;
