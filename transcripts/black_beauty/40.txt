000001|One day, while our cab and many others were waiting outside one of the parks where music was playing, a shabby old cab drove up beside ours.
000002|The horse was an old worn-out chestnut, with an ill-kept coat, and bones that showed plainly through it, the knees knuckled over, and the fore-legs were very unsteady.
000003|I had been eating some hay, and the wind rolled a little lock of it that way, and the poor creature put out her long thin neck and picked it up, and then turned and looked about for more.
000004|There was a hopeless look in the dull eye that I could not help noticing, and then, as I was thinking where I had seen that horse before, she looked full at me and said, "Black Beauty, is that you?"
000005|It was Ginger! but how changed!
000006|The beautifully arched and glossy neck was now straight, and lank, and fallen in;
000007|the clean straight legs and delicate fetlocks were swelled;
000008|the joints were grown out of shape with hard work;
000009|the face, that was once so full of spirit and life, was now full of suffering, and I could tell by the heaving of her sides, and her frequent cough, how bad her breath was.
000010|Our drivers were standing together a little way off, so I sidled up to her a step or two, that we might have a little quiet talk.
000011|It was a sad tale that she had to tell.
000012|After a twelvemonth's run off at Earlshall, she was considered to be fit for work again, and was sold to a gentleman.
000013|For a little while she got on very well, but after a longer gallop than usual the old strain returned, and after being rested and doctored she was again sold.
000014|In this way she changed hands several times, but always getting lower down.
000015|"And so at last," said she, "I was bought by a man who keeps a number of cabs and horses, and lets them out."
000016|You look well off, and I am glad of it, but I could not tell you what my life has been.
000017|When they found out my weakness they said I was not worth what they gave for me, and that I must go into one of the low cabs, and just be used up;
000018|that is what they are doing, whipping and working with never one thought of what I suffer -- they paid for me, and must get it out of me, they say.
000019|The man who hires me now pays a deal of money to the owner every day, and so he has to get it out of me too;
000020|and so it's all the week round and round, with never a Sunday rest.
000021|I said, "You used to stand up for yourself if you were ill-used."
000022|"Ah!" she said, "I did once, but it's no use;"
000023|men are strongest, and if they are cruel and have no feeling, there is nothing that we can do, but just bear it -- bear it on and on to the end.
000024|I wish the end was come, I wish I was dead.
000025|I have seen dead horses, and I am sure they do not suffer pain;
000026|I wish I may drop down dead at my work, and not be sent off to the knackers.
000027|I was very much troubled, and I put my nose up to hers, but I could say nothing to comfort her.
000028|I think she was pleased to see me, for she said, "You are the only friend I ever had."
000029|Just then her driver came up, and with a tug at her mouth backed her out of the line and drove off, leaving me very sad indeed.
000030|A short time after this a cart with a dead horse in it passed our cab-stand.
000031|The head hung out of the cart-tail, the lifeless tongue was slowly dropping with blood;
000032|and the sunken eyes! but I can't speak of them, the sight was too dreadful.
000033|It was a chestnut horse with a long, thin neck.
000034|I saw a white streak down the forehead.
000035|I believe it was Ginger;
000036|I hoped it was, for then her troubles would be over.
