000001|One day when John and I had been out on some business of our master's, and were returning gently on a long, straight road, at some distance we saw a boy trying to leap a pony over a gate;
000002|the pony would not take the leap, and the boy cut him with the whip, but he only turned off on one side.
000003|He whipped him again, but the pony turned off on the other side.
000004|Then the boy got off and gave him a hard thrashing, and knocked him about the head;
000005|then he got up again and tried to make him leap the gate, kicking him all the time shamefully, but still the pony refused.
000006|When we were nearly at the spot the pony put down his head and threw up his heels, and sent the boy neatly over into a broad quickset hedge, and with the rein dangling from his head he set off home at a full gallop.
000007|John laughed out quite loud.
000008|"Served him right," he said.
000009|"Oh, oh, oh!" cried the boy as he struggled about among the thorns;
000010|I say, come and help me out.
000011|"Thank ye," said John, "I think you are quite in the right place, and maybe a little scratching will teach you not to leap a pony over a gate that is too high for him," and so with that John rode off.
000012|"It may be," said he to himself, "that young fellow is a liar as well as a cruel one;"
000013|we'll just go home by Farmer Bushby's, Beauty, and then if anybody wants to know you and I can tell 'em, ye see.
000014|So we turned off to the right, and soon came up to the stack-yard, and within sight of the house.
000015|The farmer was hurrying out into the road, and his wife was standing at the gate, looking very frightened.
000016|"Have you seen my boy?" said mister Bushby as we came up;
000017|he went out an hour ago on my black pony, and the creature is just come back without a rider.
000018|"I should think, sir," said John, "he had better be without a rider, unless he can be ridden properly."
000019|"What do you mean?" said the farmer.
000020|Well, sir, I saw your son whipping, and kicking, and knocking that good little pony about shamefully because he would not leap a gate that was too high for him.
000021|The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice;
000022|but at last he just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge.
000023|He wanted me to help him out, but I hope you will excuse me, sir, I did not feel inclined to do so.
000024|There's no bones broken, sir;
000025|he'll only get a few scratches.
000026|I love horses, and it riles me to see them badly used;
000027|it is a bad plan to aggravate an animal till he uses his heels;
000028|the first time is not always the last.
000029|During this time the mother began to cry, "Oh, my poor Bill, I must go and meet him;"
000030|he must be hurt.
000031|"You had better go into the house, wife," said the farmer;
000032|Bill wants a lesson about this, and I must see that he gets it;
000033|this is not the first time, nor the second, that he has ill-used that pony, and I shall stop it.
000034|I am much obliged to you, Manly.
000035|Good-evening.
000036|So we went on, John chuckling all the way home;
000037|then he told James about it, who laughed and said, "Serve him right."
000038|I knew that boy at school;
000039|he took great airs on himself because he was a farmer's son;
000040|he used to swagger about and bully the little boys.
000041|Of course, we elder ones would not have any of that nonsense, and let him know that in the school and the playground farmers' sons and laborers' sons were all alike.
000042|I well remember one day, just before afternoon school, I found him at the large window catching flies and pulling off their wings.
000043|He did not see me and I gave him a box on the ears that laid him sprawling on the floor.
000044|Well, angry as I was, I was almost frightened, he roared and bellowed in such a style.
000045|The boys rushed in from the playground, and the master ran in from the road to see who was being murdered.
000046|Of course I said fair and square at once what I had done, and why;
000047|then I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill.
000048|I never saw him so angry before;
000049|but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.
000050|Then he talked to all the boys very seriously about cruelty, and said how hard-hearted and cowardly it was to hurt the weak and the helpless;
000051|but what stuck in my mind was this, he said that cruelty was the devil's own trade-mark, and if we saw any one who took pleasure in cruelty we might know who he belonged to, for the devil was a murderer from the beginning, and a tormentor to the end.
000052|On the other hand, where we saw people who loved their neighbors, and were kind to man and beast, we might know that was God's mark.
000053|"Your master never taught you a truer thing," said John;
