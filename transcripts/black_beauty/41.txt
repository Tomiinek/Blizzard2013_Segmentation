000001|I saw a great deal of trouble among the horses in London, and much of it might have been prevented by a little common sense.
000002|We horses do not mind hard work if we are treated reasonably, and I am sure there are many driven by quite poor men who have a happier life than I had when I used to go in the Countess of W -- -- 's carriage, with my silver-mounted harness and high feeding.
000003|It often went to my heart to see how the little ponies were used, straining along with heavy loads or staggering under heavy blows from some low, cruel boy.
000004|Once I saw a little gray pony with a thick mane and a pretty head, and so much like Merrylegs that if I had not been in harness I should have neighed to him.
000005|He was doing his best to pull a heavy cart, while a strong rough boy was cutting him under the belly with his whip and chucking cruelly at his little mouth.
000006|Could it be Merrylegs?
000007|It was just like him;
000008|but then mister Blomefield was never to sell him, and I think he would not do it;
000009|but this might have been quite as good a little fellow, and had as happy a place when he was young.
000010|I often noticed the great speed at which butchers' horses were made to go, though I did not know why it was so till one day when we had to wait some time in saint John's Wood.
000011|There was a butcher's shop next door, and as we were standing a butcher's cart came dashing up at a great pace.
000012|The horse was hot and much exhausted;
000013|he hung his head down, while his heaving sides and trembling legs showed how hard he had been driven.
000014|The lad jumped out of the cart and was getting the basket when the master came out of the shop much displeased.
000015|After looking at the horse he turned angrily to the lad.
000016|How many times shall I tell you not to drive in this way?
000017|You ruined the last horse and broke his wind, and you are going to ruin this in the same way.
000018|If you were not my own son I would dismiss you on the spot;
000019|it is a disgrace to have a horse brought to the shop in a condition like that;
000020|you are liable to be taken up by the police for such driving, and if you are you need not look to me for bail, for I have spoken to you till I'm tired;
000021|you must look out for yourself.
000022|During this speech the boy had stood by, sullen and dogged, but when his father ceased he broke out angrily.
000023|It wasn't his fault, and he wouldn't take the blame;
000024|he was only going by orders all the time.
000025|You always say, 'Now be quick; now look sharp!'
000026|and when I go to the houses one wants a leg of mutton for an early dinner and I must be back with it in a quarter of an hour;
000027|another cook has forgotten to order the beef;
000028|I must go and fetch it and be back in no time, or the mistress will scold;
000029|and the housekeeper says they have company coming unexpectedly and must have some chops sent up directly;
000030|and the lady at number four, in the Crescent, never orders her dinner till the meat comes in for lunch, and it's nothing but hurry, hurry, all the time.
000031|If the gentry would think of what they want, and order their meat the day before, there need not be this blow up!
000032|"I wish to goodness they would," said the butcher;
000033|'twould save me a wonderful deal of harass, and I could suit my customers much better if I knew beforehand
000034|But there! what's the use of talking -- who ever thinks of a butcher's convenience or a butcher's horse!
000035|Now, then, take him in and look to him well;
000036|mind, he does not go out again to-day, and if anything else is wanted you must carry it yourself in the basket.
000037|With that he went in, and the horse was led away.
000038|But all boys are not cruel.
000039|I have seen some as fond of their pony or donkey as if it had been a favorite dog, and the little creatures have worked away as cheerfully and willingly for their young drivers as I work for Jerry.
000040|It may be hard work sometimes, but a friend's hand and voice make it easy.
000041|There was a young coster-boy who came up our street with greens and potatoes;
000042|he had an old pony, not very handsome, but the cheerfullest and pluckiest little thing I ever saw, and to see how fond those two were of each other was a treat.
000043|The pony followed his master like a dog, and when he got into his cart would trot off without a whip or a word, and rattle down the street as merrily as if he had come out of the queen's stables.
000044|Jerry liked the boy, and called him "Prince Charlie", for he said he would make a king of drivers some day.
000045|There was an old man, too, who used to come up our street with a little coal cart;
000046|he wore a coal-heaver's hat, and looked rough and black.
000047|He and his old horse used to plod together along the street, like two good partners who understood each other;
000048|the horse would stop of his own accord at the doors where they took coal of him;
000049|he used to keep one ear bent toward his master.
000050|The old man's cry could be heard up the street long before he came near.
000051|I never knew what he said, but the children called him "Old Ba-a-ar Hoo", for it sounded like that.
