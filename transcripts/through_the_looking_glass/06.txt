000001|However, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and more human: when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had eyes and a nose and mouth;
000002|and when she had come close to it, she saw clearly that it was humpty dumpty himself.
000003|"It can't be anybody else!" she said to herself.
000004|I'm as certain of it, as if his name were written all over his face.
000005|It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous face.
000006|Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on the top of a high wall -- such a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how he could keep his balance -- and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction, and he didn't take the least notice of her, she thought he must be a stuffed figure after all.
000007|"And how exactly like an egg he is!" she said aloud, standing with her hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to fall.
000008|"It's very provoking," Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence, looking away from Alice as he spoke, "to be called an egg -- very!"
000009|"I said you looked like an egg, Sir," Alice gently explained.
000010|"And some eggs are very pretty, you know" she added, hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment.
000011|"Some people," said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her as usual, "have no more sense than a baby!"
000012|Alice didn't know what to say to this: it wasn't at all like conversation, she thought, as he never said anything to her;
000013|in fact, his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree -- so she stood and softly repeated to herself:
000014|Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall: Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
000015|All the King's horses and all the King's men Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.
000016|"That last line is much too long for the poetry," she added, almost out loud, forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her.
000017|"Don't stand there chattering to yourself like that," Humpty Dumpty said, looking at her for the first time, "but tell me your name and your business."
000018|My name is Alice, but
000019|It's a stupid enough name!
000020|Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently.
000021|What does it mean?
000022|"must a name mean something?" Alice asked doubtfully.
000023|"Of course it must," Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh: "my name means the shape I am -- and a good handsome shape it is, too."
000024|With a name like yours, you might be any shape, almost.
000025|"Why do you sit out here all alone?" said Alice, not wishing to begin an argument.
000026|"Why, because there's nobody with me!" cried Humpty Dumpty.
000027|Did you think I didn't know the answer to that?
000028|Ask another.
000029|Don't you think you'd be safer down on the ground?
000030|Alice went on, not with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured anxiety for the queer creature.
000031|That wall is so very narrow!
000032|What tremendously easy riddles you ask!
000033|Humpty Dumpty growled out.
000034|Of course I don't think so!
000035|Why, if ever I did fall off -- which there's no chance of -- but if I did.
000036|Here he pursed up his lips and looked so solemn and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing.
000037|"if I did fall," he went on, "the king has promised me -- ah, you may turn pale, if you like!"
000038|You didn't think I was going to say that, did you?
000039|the king has promised me -- with his very own mouth -- to -- to
000040|"To send all his horses and all his men," Alice interrupted, rather unwisely.
000041|Now I declare that's too bad!
000042|Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking into a sudden passion.
000043|You've been listening at doors -- and behind trees -- and down chimneys -- or you couldn't have known it!
000044|"I haven't, indeed!" Alice said very gently.
000045|It's in a book.
000046|Ah, well!
000047|"They may write such things in a book," Humpty Dumpty said in a calmer tone.
000048|That's what you call a History of England, that is.
000049|Now, take a good look at me!
000050|I'm one that has spoken to a King, I am: mayhap you'll never see such another: and to show you I'm not proud, you may shake hands with me!
000051|And he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so) and offered Alice his hand.
000052|She watched him a little anxiously as she took it.
000053|"If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet behind," she thought: "and then I don't know what would happen to his head!"
000054|I'm afraid it would come off!
000055|"Yes, all his horses and all his men," Humpty Dumpty went on.
000056|They'd pick me up again in a minute, they would!
000057|However, this conversation is going on a little too fast: let's go back to the last remark but one.
000058|"I'm afraid I can't quite remember it," Alice said very politely.
000059|"In that case we start fresh," said Humpty Dumpty, "and it's my turn to choose a subject -- "
000060|"He talks about it just as if it was a game!" thought Alice.
000061|So here's a question for you.
000062|How old did you say you were?
000063|Alice made a short calculation, and said "Seven years and six months."
000064|"Wrong!" Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly.
000065|You never said a word like it!
000066|"I though you meant 'How old are you?'" Alice explained.
000067|"If I'd meant that, I'd have said it," said Humpty Dumpty.
000068|Alice didn't want to begin another argument, so she said nothing.
000069|Seven years and six months!
000070|Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully.
000071|An uncomfortable sort of age.
000072|Now if you'd asked my advice, I'd have said "Leave off at seven" -- but it's too late now.
000073|"I never ask advice about growing," Alice said indignantly.
000074|"Too proud?" the other inquired.
000075|Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion.
000076|"I mean," she said, "that one can't help growing older."
000077|"one can't, perhaps," said Humpty Dumpty, "but two can."
000078|With proper assistance, you might have left off at seven.
000079|"What a beautiful belt you've got on!" Alice suddenly remarked.
000080|They had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn now.
000081|"At least," she corrected herself on second thoughts, "a beautiful cravat, I should have said -- no, a belt, I mean -- I beg your pardon!" she added in dismay, for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly offended, and she began to wish she hadn't chosen that subject.
000082|"If I only knew," she thought to herself, "which was neck and which was waist!"
000083|Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a minute or two.
000084|When he did speak again, it was in a deep growl.
000085|"It is a -- most -- provoking -- thing," he said at last, "when a person doesn't know a cravat from a belt!"
000086|"I know it's very ignorant of me," Alice said, in so humble a tone that Humpty Dumpty relented.
000087|It's a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say.
000088|It's a present from the White King and Queen.
000089|There now!
000090|"Is it really?" said Alice, quite pleased to find that she had chosen a good subject, after all.
000091|"They gave it me," Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, "they gave it me -- for an un-birthday present."
000092|I beg your pardon?
000093|Alice said with a puzzled air.
000094|"I'm not offended," said Humpty Dumpty.
000095|I mean, what is an un-birthday present?
000096|A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.
000097|Alice considered a little.
000098|"I like birthday presents best," she said at last.
000099|"You don't know what you're talking about!" cried Humpty Dumpty.
000100|How many days are there in a year?
000101|"Three hundred and sixty-five," said Alice.
000102|And how many birthdays have you?
000103|One.
000104|And if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what remains?
000105|Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.
000106|Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful.
000107|"I'd rather see that done on paper," he said.
000108|Alice couldn't help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and worked the sum for him:
000109|three hundred sixty-five minus one equals three hundred sixty-four
000110|Humpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully.
000111|"That seems to be done right -- " he began.
000112|"You're holding it upside down!" Alice interrupted.
000113|To be sure I was!
000114|Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned it round for him.
000115|I thought it looked a little queer.
000116|As I was saying, that seems to be done right -- though I haven't time to look it over thoroughly just now -- and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presents
000117|"Certainly," said Alice.
000118|And only one for birthday presents, you know.
000119|There's glory for you!
000120|"I don't know what you mean by 'glory,'" Alice said.
000121|Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously.
000122|Of course you don't -- till I tell you.
000123|I meant there's a nice knock-down argument for you!
000124|"But 'glory' doesn't mean a nice knock-down argument," Alice objected.
000125|"When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less."
000126|"The question is," said Alice, "whether you can make words mean so many different things."
000127|"The question is," said Humpty Dumpty, "which is to be master -- that's all."
000128|Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty Dumpty began again.
000129|They've a temper, some of them -- particularly verbs, they're the proudest -- adjectives you can do anything with, but not verbs -- however, I can manage the whole lot of them!
000130|Impenetrability!
000131|That's what I say!
000132|"Would you tell me, please," said Alice "what that means?"
000133|"Now you talk like a reasonable child," said Humpty Dumpty, looking very much pleased.
000134|I meant by "impenetrability" that we've had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you'd mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.
000135|"That's a great deal to make one word mean," Alice said in a thoughtful tone.
000136|"When I make a word do a lot of work like that," said Humpty Dumpty, "I always pay it extra."
000137|"Oh!" said Alice.
000138|She was too much puzzled to make any other remark.
000139|"Ah, you should see 'em come round me of a Saturday night," Humpty Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: "for to get their wages, you know."
000140|Alice didn't venture to ask what he paid them with;
000141|and so you see I can't tell you.
000142|"You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir," said Alice.
000143|Would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called "Jabberwocky"?"
000144|"Let's hear it," said Humpty Dumpty.
000145|I can explain all the poems that were ever invented -- and a good many that haven't been invented just yet.
000146|This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse:
000147|Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
000148|All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.
000149|"That's enough to begin with," Humpty Dumpty interrupted: "there are plenty of hard words there."
000150|"brillig" means four o'clock in the afternoon -- the time when you begin broiling things for dinner.
000151|"That'll do very well," said Alice: "and 'slithy'?"
000152|Well, 'slithy' means 'lithe and slimy.'
000153|'Lithe' is the same as 'active.'
000154|You see it's like a portmanteau -- there are two meanings packed up into one word.
000155|"I see it now," Alice remarked thoughtfully: "and what are 'toves'?"
000156|Well, 'toves' are something like badgers -- they're something like lizards -- and they're something like corkscrews.
000157|They must be very curious looking creatures.
000158|"They are that," said Humpty Dumpty: "also they make their nests under sun-dials -- also they live on cheese."
000159|And what's the 'gyre' and to 'gimble'?
000160|To 'gyre' is to go round and round like a gyroscope.
000161|To 'gimble' is to make holes like a gimlet.
000162|"And 'the wabe' is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I suppose?" said Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.
000163|Of course it is.
000164|It's called 'wabe,' you know, because it goes a long way before it, and a long way behind it --
000165|"And a long way beyond it on each side," Alice added.
000166|Exactly so.
000167|Well, then, 'mimsy' is 'flimsy and miserable' (there's another portmanteau for you).
000168|And a 'borogove' is a thin shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round -- something like a live mop.
000169|"And then "mome raths"?" said Alice."
000170|I'm afraid I'm giving you a great deal of trouble.
000171|Well, a 'rath' is a sort of green pig: but 'mome' I'm not certain about.
000172|I think it's short for "from home" -- meaning that they'd lost their way, you know.
000173|And what does 'outgrabe' mean?
000174|Well, 'outgrabing' is something between bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you'll hear it done, maybe -- down in the wood yonder -- and when you've once heard it you'll be quite content.
000175|Who's been repeating all that hard stuff to you?
000176|"I read it in a book," said Alice.
000177|But I had some poetry repeated to me, much easier than that, by -- Tweedledee, I think it was.
000178|"As to poetry, you know," said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out one of his great hands, "I can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes to that -- "
000179|Oh, it needn't come to that!
000180|Alice hastily said, hoping to keep him from beginning.
000181|"The piece I'm going to repeat," he went on without noticing her remark, "was written entirely for your amusement."
000182|Alice felt that in that case she really ought to listen to it, so she sat down, and said "Thank you" rather sadly.
000183|In winter, when the fields are white, I sing this song for your delight
000184|"only I don't sing it," he added, as an explanation.
000185|"I see you don't," said Alice.
000186|If you can see whether I'm singing or not, you've sharper eyes than most.
000187|Humpty Dumpty remarked severely.
000188|Alice was silent.
000189|In spring, when woods are getting green, I'll try and tell you what I mean.
000190|"Thank you very much," said Alice.
000191|In summer, when the days are long, Perhaps you'll understand the song: In autumn, when the leaves are brown, Take pen and ink, and write it down.
000192|"I will, if I can remember it so long," said Alice.
000193|"You needn't go on making remarks like that," Humpty Dumpty said: "they're not sensible, and they put me out."
000194|I sent a message to the fish: I told them "This is what I wish."
000195|The little fishes of the sea, They sent an answer back to me.
000196|"The little fishes" answer was "We cannot do it, Sir, because -- "
000197|"I'm afraid I don't quite understand," said Alice.
000198|"It gets easier further on," Humpty Dumpty replied.
000199|I sent to them again to say "It will be better to obey."
000200|The fishes answered with a grin, "Why, what a temper you are in!"
000201|I told them once, I told them twice: They would not listen to advice.
000202|I took a kettle large and new, Fit for the deed I had to do.
000203|My heart went hop, my heart went thump;
000204|I filled the kettle at the pump.
000205|Then some one came to me and said, "The little fishes are in bed."
000206|I said to him, I said it plain, "Then you must wake them up again."
000207|I said it very loud and clear;
000208|I went and shouted in his ear.
000209|Humpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this verse, and Alice thought with a shudder, "I wouldn't have been the messenger for anything!"
000210|But he was very stiff and proud;
000211|He said "You needn't shout so loud!"
000212|And he was very proud and stiff;
000213|He said "I'd go and wake them, if -- "
000214|I took a corkscrew from the shelf: I went to wake them up myself.
000215|And when I found the door was locked, I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.
000216|And when I found the door was shut, I tried to turn the handle, but
000217|There was a long pause.
000218|"Is that all?" Alice timidly asked.
000219|"That's all," said Humpty Dumpty.
000220|Good-bye.
000221|This was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after such a very strong hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil to stay.
000222|So she got up, and held out her hand.
000223|"Good-bye, till we meet again!" she said as cheerfully as she could.
000224|"I shouldn't know you again if we did meet," Humpty Dumpty replied in a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake;
000225|you're so exactly like other people.
000226|"The face is what one goes by, generally," Alice remarked in a thoughtful tone.
000227|"That's just what I complain of," said Humpty Dumpty.
000228|"Your face is the same as everybody has -- the two eyes, so -- marking their places in the air with this thumb "nose in the middle, mouth under."
000229|It's always the same.
000230|Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for instance -- or the mouth at the top -- that would be some help.
000231|"It wouldn't look nice," Alice objected."
000232|But Humpty Dumpty only shut his eyes and said "Wait till you've tried."
000233|"Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said "Good-bye!" once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away: but she couldn't help saying to herself as she went, "Of all the unsatisfactory;"
000234|she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to have such a long word to say;
000235|of all the unsatisfactory people I ever met.
