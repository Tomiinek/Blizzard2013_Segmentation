000001|The writer of these Oz stories has received a little note from Princess Dorothy of Oz which, for a time, has made him feel rather disconcerted.
000002|The note was written on a broad, white feather from a stork's wing, and it said:
000003|you will never hear anything more about oz, because we are now cut off forever from all the rest of the world.
000004|but toto and I will always love you and all the other children who love us.
000005|Dorothy Gale
000006|This seemed to me too bad, at first, for Oz is a very interesting fairyland.
000007|Still, we have no right to feel grieved, for we have had enough of the history of the Land of Oz to fill six story books, and from its quaint people and their strange adventures we have been able to learn many useful and amusing things.
000008|So good luck to little Dorothy and her companions.
