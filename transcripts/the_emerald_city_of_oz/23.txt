000001|They were soon among the pretty hills and valleys again, and the Sawhorse sped up hill and down at a fast and easy pace, the roads being hard and smooth.
000002|Mile after mile was speedily covered, and before the ride had grown at all tiresome they sighted another village.
000003|The place seemed even larger than Rigmarole Town, but was not so attractive in appearance.
000004|"This must be Flutterbudget Center," declared the Wizard.
000005|You see, it's no trouble at all to find places if you keep to the right road.
000006|"What are the Flutterbudgets like?" inquired Dorothy.
000007|I do not know, my dear.
000008|But Ozma has given them a town all their own, and I've heard that whenever one of the people becomes a Flutterbudget he is sent to this place to live.
000009|"That is true," Omby Amby added;
000010|Flutterbudget Center and Rigmarole Town are called 'the Defensive Settlements of Oz.'
000011|The village they now approached was not built in a valley, but on top of a hill, and the road they followed wound around the hill, like a corkscrew, ascending the hill easily until it came to the town.
000012|"Look out!" screamed a voice.
000013|Look out, or you'll run over my child!
000014|They gazed around and saw a woman standing upon the sidewalk nervously wringing her hands as she gazed at them appealingly.
000015|"Where is your child?" asked the Sawhorse.
000016|"In the house," said the woman, bursting into tears;
000017|but if it should happen to be in the road, and you ran over it, those great wheels would crush my darling to jelly.
000018|Oh dear!
000019|oh dear!
000020|Think of my darling child being crushed into jelly by those great wheels!
000021|"Gid-dap!" said the Wizard sharply, and the Sawhorse started on.
000022|They had not gone far before a man ran out of a house shouting wildly, "Help!"
000023|Help!
000024|The Sawhorse stopped short and the Wizard and Uncle Henry and the Shaggy Man and Omby Amby jumped out of the wagon and ran to the poor man's assistance.
000025|Dorothy followed them as quickly as she could.
000026|"What's the matter?" asked the Wizard.
000027|Help!
000028|"help!" screamed the man;
000029|my wife has cut her finger off and she's bleeding to death!
000030|Then he turned and rushed back to the house, and all the party went with him.
000031|They found a woman in the front dooryard moaning and groaning as if in great pain.
000032|"Be brave, madam!" said the Wizard, consolingly.
000033|You won't die just because you have cut off a finger, you may be sure.
000034|"But I haven't cut off a finger!" she sobbed.
000035|"Then what has happened?" asked Dorothy.
000036|"I -- I pricked my finger with a needle while I was sewing, and -- and the blood came!" she replied.
000037|And now I'll have blood-poisoning, and the doctors will cut off my finger, and that will give me a fever and I shall die!
000038|"Pshaw!" said Dorothy;
000039|I've pricked my finger many a time, and nothing happened.
000040|"Really?" asked the woman, brightening and wiping her eyes upon her apron.
000041|"Why, it's nothing at all," declared the girl.
000042|You're more scared than hurt.
000043|"Ah, that's because she's a Flutterbudget," said the Wizard, nodding wisely.
000044|I think I know now what these people are like.
000045|"So do I," announced Dorothy.
000046|"Oh, boo-hoo-hoo!" sobbed the woman, giving way to a fresh burst of grief.
000047|"What's wrong now?" asked the Shaggy Man.
000048|"Oh, suppose I had pricked my foot!" she wailed.
000049|Then the doctors would have cut my foot off, and I'd be lamed for life!
000050|"Surely, ma'am," replied the Wizard, "and if you'd pricked your nose they might cut your head off."
000051|But you see you didn't.
000052|"But I might have!" she exclaimed, and began to cry again.
000053|So they left her and drove away in their wagon.
000054|And her husband came out and began calling "Help!" as he had before;
000055|but no one seemed to pay any attention to him.
000056|As the travelers turned into another street they found a man walking excitedly up and down the pavement.
000057|He appeared to be in a very nervous condition and the Wizard stopped him to ask:
000058|Is anything wrong, sir?
000059|"Everything is wrong," answered the man, dismally.
000060|I can't sleep.
000061|"Why not?" inquired Omby Amby.
000062|"If I go to sleep I'll have to shut my eyes," he explained;
000063|and if I shut my eyes they may grow together, and then I'd be blind for life!
000064|"Did you ever hear of any one's eyes growing together?" asked Dorothy.
000065|"No," said the man, "I never did."
000066|But it would be a dreadful thing, wouldn't it?
000067|And the thought of it makes me so nervous I'm afraid to go to sleep.
000068|"There's no help for this case," declared the Wizard;
000069|and they went on.
000070|At the next street corner a woman rushed up to them crying:
000071|Save my baby!
000072|Oh, good, kind people, save my baby!
000073|"Is it in danger?" asked Dorothy, noticing that the child was clasped in her arms and seemed sleeping peacefully.
000074|"Yes, indeed," said the woman, nervously.
000075|If I should go into the house and throw my child out of the window, it would roll way down to the bottom of the hill;
000076|and then if there were a lot of tigers and bears down there, they would tear my darling babe to pieces and eat it up!
000077|"Are there any tigers and bears in this neighborhood?" the Wizard asked.
000078|"I've never heard of any," admitted the woman, "but if there were -- "
000079|"Have you any idea of throwing your baby out of the window?" questioned the little man.
000080|"None at all," she said;
000081|but if
000082|"All your troubles are due to those 'ifs'," declared the Wizard.
000083|If you were not a Flutterbudget you wouldn't worry.
000084|"There's another 'if'," replied the woman.
000085|Are you a Flutterbudget, too?
000086|"I will be, if I stay here long," exclaimed the Wizard, nervously.
000087|"Another 'if'!" cried the woman.
000088|But the Wizard did not stop to argue with her.
000089|He made the Sawhorse canter all the way down the hill, and only breathed easily when they were miles away from the village.
000090|After they had ridden in silence for a while Dorothy turned to the little man and asked:
000091|Do 'ifs' really make Flutterbudgets?
000092|"I think the 'ifs' help," he answered seriously.
000093|Foolish fears, and worries over nothing, with a mixture of nerves and ifs, will soon make a Flutterbudget of any one.
000094|Then there was another long silence, for all the travelers were thinking over this statement, and nearly all decided it must be true.
000095|The country they were now passing through was everywhere tinted purple, the prevailing color of the Gillikin Country;
000096|but as the Sawhorse ascended a hill they found that upon the other side everything was of a rich yellow hue.
000097|"Aha!" cried the Captain General;
000098|here is the Country of the Winkies.
000099|We are just crossing the boundary line.
000100|"Then we may be able to lunch with the Tin Woodman," announced the Wizard, joyfully.
000101|"Must we lunch on tin?" asked Aunt Em.
000102|"Oh, no;" replied Dorothy.
000103|Nick Chopper knows how to feed meat people, and he will give us plenty of good things to eat, never fear.
000104|I've been to his castle before.
000105|"Is Nick Chopper the Tin Woodman's name?" asked Uncle Henry.
000106|Yes;
000107|"that's one of his names," answered the little girl;
000108|and another of his names is 'Emp'ror of the Winkies.' He's the King of this country, you know, but Ozma rules over all the countries of Oz.
000109|"Does the Tin Woodman keep any Flutterbudgets or Rigmaroles at his castle?" inquired Aunt Em, uneasily.
000110|"No indeed," said Dorothy, positively.
000111|He lives in a new tin castle, all full of lovely things.
000112|"I should think it would rust," said Uncle Henry.
000113|"He has thousands of Winkies to keep it polished for him," explained the Wizard.
000114|His people love to do anything in their power for their beloved Emperor, so there isn't a particle of rust on all the big castle.
000115|"I suppose they polish their Emperor, too," said Aunt Em.
000116|"Why, some time ago he had himself nickel-plated," the Wizard answered;
000117|so he only needs rubbing up once in a while.
000118|He's the brightest man in all the world, is dear Nick Chopper;
000119|and the kindest-hearted.
000120|"I helped find him," said Dorothy, reflectively.
000121|Once the Scarecrow and I found the Tin Woodman in the woods, and he was just rusted still, that time, an' no mistake.
000122|But we oiled his joints an' got 'em good and slippery, and after that he went with us to visit the Wizard at the Em'rald City.
000123|"Was that the time the Wizard scared you?" asked Aunt Em.
000124|"He didn't treat us well, at first," acknowledged Dorothy;
000125|for he made us go away and destroy the Wicked Witch.
000126|But after we found out he was only a humbug wizard we were not afraid of him.
000127|The Wizard sighed and looked a little ashamed.
000128|"When we try to deceive people we always make mistakes," he said.
000129|But I'm getting to be a real wizard now, and Glinda the Good's magic, that I am trying to practice, can never harm any one.
000130|"You were always a good man," declared Dorothy, "even when you were a bad wizard."
000131|"He's a good wizard now," asserted Aunt Em, looking at the little man admiringly.
000132|The way he made those tents grow out of handkerchiefs was just wonderful!
000133|And didn't he enchant the wagon wheels so they'd find the road?
000134|"All the people of Oz," said the Captain General, "are very proud of their Wizard."
000135|He once made some soap-bubbles that astonished the world.
000136|The Wizard blushed at this praise, yet it pleased him.
000137|He no longer looked sad, but seemed to have recovered his usual good humor.
000138|The country through which they now rode was thickly dotted with farmhouses, and yellow grain waved in all the fields.
000139|Many of the Winkies could be seen working on their farms and the wild and unsettled parts of Oz were by this time left far behind.
000140|These Winkies appeared to be happy, light-hearted folk, and all removed their caps and bowed low when the red wagon with its load of travelers passed by.
000141|It was not long before they saw something glittering in the sunshine far ahead.
000142|"See!" cried Dorothy;
000143|that's the Tin Castle, Aunt Em!
